   O Tempora! O Mores! 

   DEMONSTRATORS outside Parliament rarely wear togas and brandish
   placards written in classical Greek. They did this week. The reason
   was a decision by education bureaucrats to drop a national history
   exam for 18-year-olds. If the protest naught avails, ancient history
   will no longer be taught in English schools, for the first time since
   the original Dark Ages.

   The decision to axe the A-level was taken hurriedly and in secret,
   without consulting the schools that teach ancient history or the
   universities that like it. And it comes at a time when the decline in
   classics in schools has reversed. A recent book on Latin grammar,
   "Amo, Amas, Amat", became a surprise best-seller. The number of state
   schools offering basic Latin has risen from 200 in 2003 to 459 today.
   Though some of the Thucydides-loving demonstrators were from elite
   private schools, others were from grungy further-education colleges.

   As they waited for Boris Johnson, the Tory education spokesman, to
   address them (in Latin), the pupil-protesters chanted "Long live
   Athens! Down with Sparta". Fine sentiments. But remember what happened
   to Athens.
