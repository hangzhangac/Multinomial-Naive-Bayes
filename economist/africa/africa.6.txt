   In an [3]article on reforming Nigeria's oil industry (September 29th),
   we said that the country's production had sunk to just 750,000 barrels
   a day, owing to violence in the Delta region. What we meant to say is
   that oil production had fallen by 750,000 b/d, well below Nigeria's
   capacity of 3m b/d, but not nearly as catastrophic. Sorry.
