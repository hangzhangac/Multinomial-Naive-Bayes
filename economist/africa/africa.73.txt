   A prominent critic of President Robert Mugabe resigns


   THE Archbishop of Bulawayo, Pius Ncube, has joined the crowded ranks
   of those felled for speaking out against Zimbabwe's president, Robert
   Mugabe. In July, the state-run media aired photographs that they said
   showed the archbishop in a compromising position with a married
   secretary of his parish.

                                                                  Reuters
                                                                  Reuters

                                           Will his voice still be heard?

   His supporters said it was a conspiracy to discredit him; Zimbabwe's
   Catholic church also stood by him. For many years he has criticised Mr
   Mugabe's regime in the strongest possible terms. But this week, facing
   adultery charges in court, he stepped down as archbishop of Zimbabwe's
   second largest city, denouncing the "crude machinations of a wicked
   regime".

   The 60-year-old explained his decision as a move to protect his fellow
   bishops and the Catholic church. The government said his resignation
   was an admission of guilt. Some people believe he was, indeed, the
   victim of a cleverly-sprung government honey-trap.

   Earlier this year, after opposition leaders had been arrested and
   beaten up, he called for street protests and, later, for foreign
   intervention to oust Mr Mugabe. He also said he was praying for the
   president's death. Mr Mugabe, himself brought up as a Catholic, told
   clergy who spoke out against him that they were on a "dangerous path".

   Archbishop Ncube, who took up his post in Bulawayo in 1997, is an
   Ndebele whose homeland, in western Zimbabwe, was subject to the
   government's brutal repression in the 1980s, leaving many thousands of
   people dead. He said he would remain a Catholic bishop and would not
   be silenced. But it is unclear whether he will retain his moral
   authority.
