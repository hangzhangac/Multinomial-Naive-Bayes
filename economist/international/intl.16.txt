   Needed: a new way to get the Kyoto bargain to work 

   SOME sceptics say the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), part of the
   Kyoto protocol, is like paying someone else to stop smoking for you.
   The basic idea: projects that cut or prevent emissions of greenhouse
   gases in poor countries earn credits, which can be bought by rich
   countries in lieu of curbing their own emissions. After a slow start
   China now leads the pack in using the CDM, accounting for 61% of the
   market in 2006, which was worth nearly $5 billion.

   The logical next stage for the CDM is a switch to a "programmatic"
   approach. Instead of approving abatement projects one at a time, this
   would allow similar projects to be grouped together for approval.
   Typical examples might include rural biogas, solar water-heating and
   small hydropower projects, all of which deliver
   "sustainable-development" gains too, says Anne Arquit Niederberger of
   Policy Solution, a consultancy.

   One specific idea comes from the Joint US-China Co-operation on Clean
   Energy, a non-profit group. It plans to distribute 10m free compact
   fluorescent lamps to homes in China. This could save around 3.5m
   tonnes of carbon-dioxide emissions over four years. This is one of
   three projects being studied as a model for a future approach to the
   CDM. Sceptics are posing some hard questions: who will monitor
   individual projects within a programme? What if the market is flooded
   with credits, and prices crash? Findings from a forthcoming World Bank
   report on the CDM in China will be discussed in Bali; but this may
   produce more questions than answers.
