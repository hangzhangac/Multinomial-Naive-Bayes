   Zimbabweans opt for hardship in South Africa rather than hopelessness
   at home


   ON A dirt road in Weipe, a farming area in South Africa on the banks
   of the Limpopo river about 60km (37 miles) west of the busy Beitbridge
   border post, a few cars are waiting. Unemployed South Africans try to
   make a bit of money driving Zimbabweans--either locally employed or
   freshly arrived from across the river--wherever they want to go. But
   business is hard, as many new immigrants have no money. And there is
   also the risk of being arrested by the police for transporting people
   without visas.

   When a police car duly arrives, the few bystanders hoping for a ride
   quickly vanish into the bush. Two friendly policemen stop the vehicles
   driving past, checking the passengers' papers. Six illegal Zimbabweans
   are picked up and ushered into the police car. They will be driven to
   the military base south of Musina, the nearby town, and deported
   within 24 hours.

   Nick van der Vyver, who heads the office of the Geneva-based
   International Organisation for Migration on the Zimbabwean side of
   Beitbridge, says that so far this year an average of about 570
   deported Zimbabweans cross his threshold every day. The figure is
   higher than last year's, and is probably far smaller than the number
   of those who do not get caught. Of those who do, most will probably be
   back on the South African side of the border within a few days;
   sealing over 200km of border is almost impossible. They add to the
   thousands who cross legally, in both directions.

   The numbers say much about the desperation and determination of the
   impoverished Zimbabweans fleeing a country that is collapsing around
   them. Over 3m Zimbabweans are thought to have left their homeland (out
   of a population of 13m), most of them for South Africa. It is there
   that many already have friends or relations and where the economic
   opportunities are presumed to be best. But these emigrants are now
   causing problems far beyond the border.

   At this time of year the Limpopo is dry, making it easy to cross by
   foot. But in the rainy season Zimbabweans dreaming of a better life
   drown in the surging waters, or are occasionally killed by crocodiles.
   Almost as dangerous are those who offer to help them cross for money:
   they often rob them blind or worse.

   And crossing the border is only the beginning of their problems. Once
   they are in South Africa, making a living is hard. Some find jobs on
   farms, with minimum monthly salaries of about 1,000 rand ($142): not
   much, but still more than ten times a teacher's salary in Zimbabwe at
   the unofficial exchange rate. Many professionals, unable to survive at
   home with 80% unemployment, inflation heading for 100,000% (according
   to the IMF) and severe shortages of basic items such as meat, sugar
   and cooking oil, are also coming over. An association of Zimbabwean
   teachers in Johannesburg tries to help its 3,500 members with papers,
   professional certification, advice and jobs. Doctor Ncube, the
   chairman, believes there are over 10,000 Zimbabwean teachers in South
   Africa.

   Limkani, who once taught in a secondary school in Matabeleland, hauled
   boxes in a warehouse for 75 rand a day when he came to South Africa in
   2005. Another high-school teacher speaks of the one-bedroom flat he
   shares with seven others. His work permit means he is among the lucky
   ones. But he is struggling to win certification as a teacher in South
   Africa: he needs a letter from the Zimbabwean authorities, which say
   they have no stationery.

   Many cannot even afford housing. In central Johannesburg the Methodist
   church has become a refuge for about 1,000 people, most of them
   Zimbabweans. At night the building bursts with people sleeping on
   every inch of floor; all must share just six lavatories. A Zimbabwean
   salesman has been living there for about a year. He finds occasional
   jobs as a security guard for 70 rand a day. Like most Zimbabweans in
   South Africa, he sends groceries and money home to his wife and
   children whenever he can.

   The vast majority leave Zimbabwe because they cannot make ends meet.
   But some are escaping political persecution. Pianos, a 43-year-old
   official of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), shows
   multiple scars on his face, legs and knees from the beatings he says
   he received from the police and pro-government youth militia. He fled
   after an opposition gathering on March 11th, during which MDC leaders
   were arrested and later beaten up. He is now hoping to obtain
   political asylum. But, even if successful, this will take years--and
   his wife and four of his children remain in Zimbabwe.

   Many Zimbabweans say they will go back if things improve at home. In
   the meantime, though, Zimbabwe is losing its people and South Africa
   has a problem on its hands. With an unemployment rate of 26%, or
   closer to 40% by some measures, it can hardly absorb the flow. Some
   locals feel that Zimbabweans are competing for scarce jobs and adding
   to the crime rate, although there is no hard evidence to support this.
   The opposition Democratic Alliance wants refugee camps set up; the
   government disagrees, saying that most Zimbabweans are economic
   migrants, not refugees.

   South Africa's government has been heavily criticised for not doing
   more to hasten the end of President Robert Mugabe's disastrous regime.
   One of its excuses for not pushing harder has been fear of
   precipitating a crisis in Zimbabwe that would adversely affect South
   Africa. But it is hard to escape the conclusion that the damage is
   already being done.


   The Kurds say they still want more of it 


   THIS week's death sentence on Ali Hassan al-Majid, architect of the
   Anfal (Spoils) campaign in 1987-1988 against Iraq's Kurds, of whom up
   to 180,000 may have been killed, does not mark the end of the affair.
   After months of evidence of gassing, deportations and mass graves,
   Iraq's special tribunal found "Chemical Ali", as Saddam Hussein's
   cousin is more widely known, guilty of various heinous crimes,
   including, most significantly for the Kurds, genocide. But Nechirvan
   Barzani, prime minister of Iraq's Kurdistan region, said that the
   tribunal's definition of the Anfal as a genocide was just a first step
   in a new campaign to have that military operation recognised as a
   genocide by the rest of the Arab world as well as by international
   bodies such as the UN.

   The Kurds have long sought such recognition for the Anfal as well as
   separate acknowledgement for the crime of the gas attack on the town
   of Halabja, where 5,000-odd people were killed in 1988. In the
   mid-1990s a New York-based lobby, Human Rights Watch (HRW), which
   documented the Anfal crimes, including the razing of 3,000-plus
   Kurdish villages, tried to bring the issue before the UN Security
   Council. But too few big countries backed the move.

   This week's decision by the Iraqi court is unlikely to give the Kurds
   the momentum they need: many outsiders question the independence and
   fairness of the special tribunal in Baghdad. And it is unclear how
   much support Iraq's Kurds would get from their Arab compatriots in a
   campaign to win recognition of those mass crimes. Many of Iraq's Sunni
   Arabs say privately that the Kurds deserved what they got because
   their fighters sided with Iran in the war with Iraq in the 1980s--an
   argument used by Mr Majid in the trial just ended.

   In the early 1990s Kanan Makiya, an Iraqi Shia Arab, in a book called
   "Cruelty and Silence", lambasted Arab politicians and intellectuals in
   the region for their silence about the regime's brutalities. This
   week's reaction, muttered the Kurds, was not so different. Pan-Arab
   satellite television channels covered the trial and its verdict
   widely. But its commentators and those in Arab newspapers dwelt little
   on the mass murders for which Mr Majid was condemned.


   A politician who paid the price for telling Israelis unpalatable
   truths

   ABROAD he has a reputation as a tireless peacemaker; at home he is a
   byword for political failure. When Yossi Beilin announced his decision
   to step down as head of the left-liberal Meretz party at its next
   leadership election in the spring, there were palpable sighs of relief
   not just from his rivals but also from his friends, who hope that he
   still has a chance to be remembered for his bold statesmanship instead
   of his defective leadership.

   Mr Beilin was one of the first mainstream Israeli politicians to push
   for what most Israelis now accept: the need to give the Palestinians
   an independent state. And it was largely thanks to him that serious
   peace talks first got going. In the early 1990s, when Israel was
   talking to local Palestinian leaders in an attempt to circumvent the
   exiled Yasser Arafat and his Palestine Liberation Organisation in
   Tunis, Mr Beilin argued as a youthful deputy foreign minister that
   without Arafat, whom most Israelis dismissed as an incorrigible
   terrorist, peace talks would be worthless. With the backing of Shimon
   Peres, he encouraged the secret meetings in Oslo between an Arafat
   aide and two Israeli peace activists that led eventually to the famous
   handshake between Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn.

   He stuck to his views even as the peace process collapsed, the violent
   second intifada erupted and the international "road map" that followed
   it began to stall, arguing to the last that Arafat was the only
   Palestinian leader who had the standing to make peace. In 2003 he and
   a Palestinian counterpart launched another peace plan, the Geneva
   Accord, which, even with the intifada raging, won the support of some
   30% of Israelis. According to Dov Weisglass, an adviser to Ariel
   Sharon, the popularity of this unofficial "civil society" initiative
   was one factor that prompted the then prime minister to ignore the
   rage of his own Likud party and extract Israel's soldiers and settlers
   from Gaza in 2005.

   Lately Mr Beilin has courted unpopularity by speaking reluctantly of
   the need for Israel to do business, through a third party, with the
   rejectionists of Hamas now that they have deposed Arafat's old Fatah
   movement and control the Gaza Strip. His daring has long hurt his
   political career. When Palestinian suicide-bombings disheartened
   Israel's peace camp he lost his relevance to Labour, left to head
   Meretz, and ran it into the ground. His own defence, that other
   parties had appropriated Meretz's peace agenda, is only partly true;
   he neglected its other core issues such as social justice and civil
   rights. An allegedly dictatorial management style did not help.

   By contrast, Mr Peres, who had shifted from a hawk in his early days
   to a dove by the time Mr Beilin worked for him, shifted effortlessly
   back to the political centre and is now Israel's president. There is
   no question who has been the cannier politician. But Mr Beilin has
   been perhaps Israel's boldest peacenik. He will be missed, if his
   departure from the arena is permanent.


   President Mwai Kibaki is loth to back down after his fraudulent
   election victory

                                                               AP/Reuters

                                 AP/Reuters


   IT SEEMED that Kenya had pulled out of its nosedive into violence
   earlier this week--until the "big man" complex pulled the country back
   towards disaster. Now the recalcitrance of its disputed president,
   Mwai Kibaki, egged on by his bloody-minded backers, threatens to wreck
   east Africa's most prosperous economy and increases the chance of a
   drawn-out civil conflict. Ghana's president, John Kufuor, who
   currently chairs the African Union, is still trying to mediate, but so
   far in vain. Despite a concerted call for peace by Kenya's leading
   editors, businessmen and bishops, the prospect of an early compromise
   looks dim.

   Earlier, the opposition leader, Raila Odinga, who claims he was
   cheated of victory by Mr Kibaki thanks to a false count after the
   presidential poll on December 27th, told his Orange Democratic
   Movement supporters to put off planned demonstrations in order to give
   international mediation a chance to work. Mr Odinga continued to
   insist that Mr Kibaki was an "illegal" president but his agreement to
   avoid the possibility of a lethal street clash between the Oranges and
   security forces was seen as a breakthrough. The next day, however, Mr
   Kibaki responded with apparent contempt to Mr Odinga's climbdown by
   unilaterally appointing 17 cabinet ministers. That was also a slap in
   the face of foreign diplomats who thought they had a deal with Mr
   Kibaki not to make any appointments until the business of mediation
   had run its course.

   So more riots broke out--and more deaths look certain. At least 500
   Kenyans have so far been killed. Thousands more have been wounded by
   gunfire, hacked by machetes, beaten with sticks, or scorched in fires.
   Most of the victims have been Kikuyus, from Mr Kibaki's tribe, the
   country's largest and richest, making up some 22%. The local Red Cross
   estimates that 200,000 Kenyans have been displaced, nearly all of them
   for ethnic reasons. The worry is that reprisals by Kikuyu gangs in
   areas where Kikuyus predominate, particularly against Mr Odinga's
   fellow Luos, may feed a fresh cycle of bloodshed. "If the reprisals
   start," says a senior civil servant, "I fear you could see the armed
   forces breaking into tribal factions."

   Mr Kibaki's choice of cabinet ministers does not suggest he is
   reaching out to those who opposed him. In the parliamentary poll, held
   at the same time as the presidential one, Kenyans sent a clear message
   of disgust with corruption and cronyism. Oranges won 95 of the 210
   contested seats, more than twice as many as Mr Kibaki's Party of
   National Unity; half of Mr Kibaki's cabinet lost their seats. Yet
   several of his new ministers are widely regarded as some of the most
   venal of the old guard; several have been threatened with travel bans
   to the European Union, including Britain, because of corruption
   allegations.

   Among those thought to be encouraging Mr Kibaki to give no ground are
   John Michuki, who previously ran internal security and is now in
   charge of roads, and George Saitoti, who goes from education to handle
   internal security. Mr Michuki was involved in attempts during Mr
   Kibaki's first term to use foreign mercenaries to stop local media
   from publishing some stories to do with organised crime. This pair's
   prominence suggests that Mr Kibaki is ready to use repression to stay
   in power.

   Mr Kibaki has also failed to break with his discredited predecessor,
   Daniel arap Moi, three of whose sons lost their seats in parliament:
   Mr Kibaki has put several of Mr Moi's favourites into the cabinet,
   including Uhuru Kenyatta, a son of Kenya's founding president. He has
   also named Kalonzo Musyoka, a Kamba, who came a distant third in the
   presidential race, as vice-president, in the hope of winning his
   party's much-needed votes in parliament.

   The Daily Nation, Kenya's biggest newspaper, reckons that it has been
   the country's darkest period since independence in 1963. The violence
   has not ceased since the election result. The tension has been
   worsened by incendiary text messages, such as one that falsely said a
   busload of Luo women and children had been blown up by Kikuyus in
   western Kenya.

   The security forces can barely cope without resorting to violence.
   There were too few to contain opposition protesters peacefully in
   Nairobi in the days after the poll--but enough to gun them down. "No
   Raila, no peace," went the standard chant that has landed a number of
   Orange supporters in prison. Protesters near the smart Yaya shopping
   mall, a mile or so from central Nairobi, seemed poised to loot the
   building. A few started throwing stones at its windows, while others
   pulled petrol bombs out of sisal sacks. Hot-heads spoke of taking
   their fight against Mr Kibaki to the bush in a war of liberation.
   "Have you ever seen someone cut up, the legs here, the head over
   there?" asked a youth brandishing a rusty spanner. "That's what we'll
   do to the Kikuyus." Just as gunfire threatened to break out, William
   Ruto, an Orange leader, persuaded the mob to back down.

   The violence spreads

   For days, Nairobi's slums were sealed off by security forces, causing
   widespread hunger. In Kibera, on the city's south side, what little
   food there was reached prices the poor could not possibly afford.
   Children collapsed under barrages of tear-gas. There was not enough
   water to wash their eyes. Corpses lay unclaimed in the fetid dust,
   some shot, others slashed. Ethnic cleansing went on despite the siege.
   Thousands of Kikuyus fled their tiny shacks, escaping through the
   nearby Ngong forest with dirty bundles of meagre possessions to take
   refuge in Nairobi's showground beyond. Kikuyus trying to enter Kibera
   were dragged out and beaten up by Luos.

   The violence was, if anything, worse upcountry, where gangs of young
   men from the Kalenjin group turned on their Kikuyu neighbours in the
   Rift Valley. Many of the deaths there, including the burning to death
   of Kikuyus in a church, occurred in and around the town of Eldoret,
   whose Kikuyus fled, taking buses or lorries south to Nakuru, under
   government protection.

   The conspicuously quietest bit of the country has been the Kikuyu
   highlands stretching up north of Nairobi to the slopes of Mount Kenya.
   About 97% of Central Province's voters were officially said to have
   plumped for Mr Kibaki. In mainly Kikuyu towns such as Thika, Luos
   working in government offices have fled. "We are not sure if they will
   come back," says the district commissioner. "The situation is worst in
   the coffee estates and isolated farms. We can't offer protection
   there."

   Poorer Luos still working in Thika live harmoniously with other tribes
   in makeshift settlements on the edge of the town. "We don't say
   anything too loud," says a young Luo. "The problem is the Kikuyus are
   too arrogant. They feel they have a right to rule." Unsurprisingly,
   the Kikuyu view is different. "We're civilised and they are not," says
   a Kikuyu mini-bus driver in the market-place, to applause from his
   friends.

   So far the instability has cost the country $1 billion, says the
   finance ministry. The cost of borrowing abroad is likely to rise, the
   overvalued Kenyan shilling will fall, tourism has already been badly
   hit and foreign aid may be cut back. Planned privatisations will get
   greater scrutiny; some may falter. There may not be enough money to
   keep Mr Kibaki's promise of free secondary education for all. But
   breaking it would sorely undermine him.

   Kenya's neighbours are being hurt too. Several, such as south Sudan
   and Uganda are landlocked, so rely on Kenya's roads and its port of
   Mombasa for their trade to the outside world. Uganda is particularly
   jittery. Its president, Yoweri Museveni, wants Kenyan troops to
   protect oil en route to the Ugandan border and says Uganda must build
   its own oil terminal to lessen its dependency on Mombasa. While
   Kenya's big men refuse to compromise, the country's reputation as a
   beacon of stability in a sea of regional turbulence is in tatters.


   Jacob Zuma, presidential hopeful

                                                                  Reuters
                                                                  Reuters

                                                                Party man


   ONCE his country's deputy president, Jacob Zuma has had a rough few
   years. He was sacked by President Thabo Mbeki in 2005 after his
   financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, was convicted of fraud and
   corruption. The following year he was tried for rape. He was
   acquitted, but then faced charges of fraud and corruption. The case
   was kicked out of court, but the National Prosecuting Authority may
   still have another go. The veteran political leader has been ridiculed
   and vilified, written off by many as politically finished or unfit to
   rule.

   All this would have buried the career of many other politicians. Yet,
   surprisingly, Mr Zuma, who is still deputy leader of the ruling
   African National Congress (ANC) party, remains a front-runner to win
   the presidency of the party in elections due in December. That would
   make him a virtual shoo-in to be South Africa's next president when Mr
   Mbeki goes in 2009.

   His home in a rich, formerly all-white neighbourhood of Johannesburg
   feels as laid back as the man himself appears. Local music plays in
   the background and people casually come in and out. A portrait of
   himself painted on a goat skin towers over the room from the
   mezzanine. Wearing an elegant suit and laughing often, Mr Zuma is
   engaging without being familiar, as well as articulate and imposing.
   Yet for all the friendliness, the bruises of the past few years show;
   he offers guarded and careful answers.

   Unlike many ANC leaders, Mr Zuma, born into a very poor family in
   KwaZulu Natal, received little formal education. By 15 he was taking
   odd jobs to help his widowed mother make ends meet. This, added to his
   years as a political prisoner and an exile in Zambia, Swaziland and
   Mozambique during apartheid, partly explains his popularity among the
   ANC rank-and-file. He is at home among ordinary South Africans, who
   feel he is one of them. His ease in crowds and at rallies has often
   been compared favourably to the stiff and cerebral style of Mr Mbeki.

   Mr Zuma joined the ANC in the late 1950s, still a teenager, and rose
   through the ranks to become head of intelligence when the party was
   underground. His ability to listen and bring people together was
   instrumental in putting an end to violence between the ANC and the
   largely Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party in the 1990s. He successfully
   applied the same negotiating skills in Burundi a few years later.

   But then there are the scandals. An investigation relating to a
   government arms deal from the late 1990s still hangs over him. The
   lengthy saga has so far not translated into a trial that could either
   confirm the accusations or put them to rest. Mr Zuma argues that this
   is unfair, and attributes much of his support within the ANC to the
   way he has been treated. Critics argue that the more recent Shaik case
   and the rape trial have highlighted, at best, serious lapses of
   judgement. Most damaging was his admission in court that he had had
   unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman, and had then taken a
   shower to limit the risks of infection. This was met with outrage and
   disbelief by many, especially as Mr Zuma had headed the government's
   official anti-AIDS campaign.

   Mr Zuma believes that the court cases in themselves have not tarnished
   his reputation with supporters, but that the media have damaged his
   image with the broader public. "They have deliberately made a joke out
   of me," he says bitterly. His most ardent supporters, to be found
   within an eclectic crowd of disgruntled ANC and trade-union members,
   go one step further and maintain that he is the victim of a political
   conspiracy.

   More worrying is whether Mr Zuma's primary political talent is to say
   whatever people want to hear, regardless of consequences. He was
   accused of gay-bashing for comments he made during a speech about
   traditional Zulu values. He said he was misunderstood and apologised.
   There are also concerns that the support Mr Zuma enjoys from trade
   unions and the left of the ANC could lead to a shift in economic
   policy were he to become president. But for all his apparent
   outspokenness and gregariousness, the ANC deputy president is, above
   all, a disciplined party man. "When the ANC decides, the party view
   becomes my view," he says, before adding that "One critical thing in
   the ANC is unity and collective leadership." A recent ANC policy
   conference broadly endorsed the current government's economic
   direction, which has underpinned good macroeconomic performance.

   This may explain why business circles do not seem too worried about
   the prospect of a Zuma presidency. It may also be true that many do
   not believe he will be South Africa's next president. The ANC branches
   are about to start debating their choice of nominee for the party
   leadership. Mr Zuma dismisses questions over whether he would accept a
   nomination, but characteristically argues that he has never refused
   any job that the ANC has asked him to do.


   Syria is finding it hard to cope with the flood of refugees from Iraq

                                                                  Reuters
                                                                  Reuters

                                                       Damascene survival


   "DO YOU have a job?" and "What are you doing at the moment?" are
   leading questions on the whiteboard in an English lesson at an Iraqi
   refugee community centre in Sayyida Zaynab, a suburb on the edge of
   Syria's capital, Damascus. The students can expect more such requests
   for personal data in the coming weeks as the Syrian government and the
   UN carry out a census to count those who have fled from neighbouring
   Iraq.

   Syria has taken in the lion's share of Iraq's refugees, about 1.5m of
   them, of whom well over half are probably Sunni, some 15% Shia and
   maybe 10% Christian. Jordan is thought to account for another 600,000
   or so, but no one knows exactly. The Syrian survey will assess the
   needs of the refugees--and their effect on the host country, which has
   19m of its own citizens. Many refugees are running out of savings,
   slipping into poverty, sometimes into crime and prostitution.

   The count will be difficult. If they were all in camps, it would be
   easier, says Kristele Younes of Refugees International. "It's the
   first time in the UN's history that there's been an urban crisis of
   such huge proportions," she says. "They are people who are very
   difficult to `see'. They speak Arabic and look pretty similar [to
   Syrians]. It's almost a ghost population."

   In Sayyida Zaynab, near a Shia shrine to Zaynab, the Prophet
   Muhammad's granddaughter, the streets teem with Iraqis. Shops have
   been taken over by Iraqis, restaurants such as the Bakery Bagdady
   [sic] sell Iraqi specialities unknown to Syrians, and travel agents
   offer trips to the border for 500 Syrian pounds ($10). Some 350,000
   Iraqis may have moved into this area alone, putting a strain on water
   and electricity supplies as well as on schools.

   The Syrian Arab Red Crescent, together with the Office of the UN High
   Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has opened a clinic to cope with
   the influx of sick Iraqis. Inside, the waiting area is packed. Dr
   Akram al-Hasani, a Syrian orthopaedic surgeon, is examining a Basra
   man still suffering from an arm wound after being shot four years ago.
   "We have many trauma victims," he says. "And a large proportion of
   children with congenital problems, more than among Syrians."

   In the mainly Christian district of Jaramana, a clinic at the Deir
   Ibrahim Khalil convent has an equally wide range of problems.
   "Depression, depression, depression," says Sister Malekeh, a Greek
   Catholic nun. "It's very sad. Now we have a psychiatrist who started
   two months ago. Before they didn't accept it and wouldn't come to the
   clinic, but now they have started to come."

   In a census in 1987, there were said to be 1.4m Christians in Iraq. In
   the 1990s, the figure shrank to 1m or so. After Saddam Hussein's
   demise, they began to be targeted, mainly by Sunni groups linked to
   al-Qaeda, so most have now fled. An Anglican churchman says that some
   1.25m Iraqi Christians now live outside Iraq, with about 250,000 left
   behind.

   International aid workers are queuing up to work in Syria, to relieve
   the burden on the UN agencies and on the Red Crescent. Eight
   charities, including Islamic Relief and the Norwegian and Danish
   Refugee Councils, have been negotiating for months to start projects.
   The foreign ministry has given its approval, but they must work under
   the umbrella of the local Red Crescent, which has been slow to reach
   agreement with the various groups. The Ministry for Social Affairs and
   Labour, which oversees local NGOs, says that Syrian ones should work
   mainly for Syrians.

   Moreover, Syrian attitudes to Iraqis are hardening, as the numbers
   overwhelm local services. The government also worries about the cost
   of providing the extra population with heavily subsidised bread, fuel
   and other goods.

   The UNHCR has managed to register only 135,000 refugees, a fraction of
   those who have arrived. And they are still trickling in, despite new
   rules that have in effect closed the border. Only certain favoured
   categories of applicants, such as lorry drivers, businessmen,
   academics and engineers, are now being allowed in, with occasional
   exceptions for the sick.

   America agonises over the pitfalls of staying in Iraq--and of leaving


   "AMERICA is between two fires. If it stays in Iraq, it will bleed to
   death; if it leaves, it will lose everything." So said Ayman
   al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, in 2004. If he is right, can
   America extract itself from this trap?

   When America's senior commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, and
   its ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, brief Congress on the state
   of the war from September 10th onwards, they will find a capital
   divided. Much of Congress has decided that the war is lost and the
   troops should be brought home. Others believe that General Petraeus's
   "surge" is starting to work and that the politicians are in danger of
   losing a war the army is beginning to win.

   More than four years on, "winning" can of course no longer mean what
   the architects of the 2003 invasion hoped for. President George Bush
   aimed not only to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
   but also to liberate it from dictatorship and create a pro-Western
   democracy in the heart of the Arab world.

   These high hopes have burned to ash. Saddam is dead and Iraqis voted
   freely in 2005 for their present government. But there were no WMD,
   the government is in chaos and the country is ravaged by violence.
   Under occupation Iraq has become both a recruiting-sergeant and a
   training ground for al-Qaeda. The civilian death toll is contested,
   but almost certainly exceeds 100,000. More than 3,700 American
   soldiers (and nearly 300 other coalition soldiers) have died. The
   serious debate is therefore not between victory or defeat but over how
   to mitigate the consequences of a disaster that has already taken
   place.

   The violence in Iraq is not distributed evenly. In the north the Kurds
   have carved out an autonomous and largely peaceful enclave (see
   [4]article) although there is potentially explosive conflict over the
   status of Kirkuk. In the four south-eastern provinces most violence
   has been either directed at the small British garrison in the port
   city of Basra, or is part of a turf fight between Shia militias such
   as the Badr brigade and the Mahdi army, both affiliated to Shia
   political blocks in parliament.

   General Petraeus's surge of recent months has not aimed at these
   areas, but has concentrated on Baghdad and the intensely violent
   centre of the country. There, at least three overlapping wars are
   raging. One consists of attacks by the jihadists of al-Qaeda against
   the Americans, government forces and Shia civilians. Another is a
   sectarian war between Sunnis and Shias. Last, many Sunnis and Shias
   alike attack the Americans simply because they are seen as unwanted
   foreign occupiers. A poll in September 2006 found that 92% of Sunnis
   and 62% of Shias approved of such attacks.

   The surge is not only a reinforcement but also, more important, a
   change of tactics. General Petraeus has deployed some 30,000 extra
   troops, bringing the grand total to about 160,000. More significant
   has been the new plan. Under General George Casey, General Petraeus's
   predecessor, the aim was to put Iraq's army in charge of security. Now
   the Americans have taken charge of protecting Iraq's civilians
   themselves. Instead of moving on after pacifying a neighbourhood, only
   for insurgents to return in their wake, they stay put.

   Is the surge working? The answer is in the eye of the beholder. In an
   interview in the Australian on August 31st, General Petraeus said the
   new approach had made his soldiers "pursuers instead of defenders",
   putting al-Qaeda "off-balance at the very least". He said the number
   of sectarian killings in Baghdad had fallen by August to a quarter of
   its December level, and the number of weapons-cache finds had doubled.
   He called al-Qaeda "enemy number one", because its mass murders had
   ignited sectarian violence. But Iran's "malign involvement" in arming
   and directing Shia militias was also a problem.

   In a separate assessment of progress, the authors of America's
   National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) said in August that there had
   been "measurable but uneven" improvements in security. The report,
   approved by 16 intelligence agencies, concluded that a previously
   steep escalation in violence had been checked. If robust
   counter-insurgency operations continued, said the NIE, security would
   improve modestly in the next six to 12 months, but overall violence
   would remain high.

   Two influential Washington think-tankers who visited Iraq in
   July--Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack of the Brookings
   Institution--returned somewhat upbeat. They concluded that the surge
   had improved security and economic conditions in areas where General
   Petraeus had concentrated his forces. The Americans were working
   alongside Iraqi units that seemed more competent and less sectarian
   than before. But a commission headed by James Jones, a retired marine
   general, told Congress this week that the army's effectiveness was
   "limited", the interior ministry "dysfunctional" and the police
   riddled with sectarianism.

   A stroke of luck in Anbar

   Even the reports of modest progress need to be read with the utmost
   caution. That is because the single best bit of news is a stroke of
   luck that probably had little to do with General Petraeus's surge and
   may not last. In some Sunni-dominated provinces, especially Anbar,
   local tribal leaders who previously supported al-Qaeda have been
   repelled by the high-handed brutality of the foreign jihadists and are
   now working with the Americans. Last year, al-Qaeda controlled wide
   areas of Anbar and American officers deemed the province lost. Now it
   is one of the safer parts of Iraq.

   On September 3rd Mr Bush paid a surprise visit to an American base in
   Anbar, citing the province as proof that "success is possible".
   Besides posing for photos, he met Iraq's prime minister, Nuri
   al-Maliki, and local sheikhs. "The people of this province are seeing
   that standing up to the extremists is the path to a better life," said
   Mr Bush. To the people of Anbar and Iraq, he promised that "America
   does not abandon our friends." Addressing the audience back home, he
   said that "if the kind of success we are now seeing continues, it will
   be possible to maintain the same level of security with fewer American
   forces."

   The turnaround in Anbar is real. The question is how durable it is.
   Anthony Cordesman, of the Centre for Strategic and International
   Studies, returned from a visit in July convinced that the Sunnis who
   had been fighting American forces were now willing to work alongside
   the Shia-dominated government if offered money, status and a share of
   power. The authors of the NIE are less optimistic. They say Sunni
   resistance to al-Qaeda has not yet turned into support for the
   government or a willingness to work with the Shias.

                                                                      AFP
                                                                      AFP

                                                 Her window on the future

   Nor, understandably, does the government yet trust these potential new
   allies. In August seven American soldiers approaching the end of their
   tour in Iraq published an op-ed article in the New York Times that
   cast doubt on claims of progress. It was true that armed Sunni tribes
   had become American allies. "But the enduring question is where their
   loyalties would lie in our absence. The Iraqi government finds itself
   working at cross-purposes with us on this issue because it is
   justifiably fearful that Sunni militias will turn on it should the
   Americans leave."

   Another reason for caution is that even if the Sunni change of heart
   keeps al-Qaeda off balance, jihadist attacks make up only one of those
   three Iraqi wars. The surge has yet to dampen down the civil war
   between Sunnis and Shias. Despite the drop General Petraeus points to
   in Baghdad's death toll, Sunnis are still being hounded out of mixed
   neighbourhoods--often by the national police and the interior
   ministry, which are riddled with Shia militias. The third war
   continues, too. Even as America tries to reduce sectarian violence,
   its soldiers still come under attack by Sunnis and Shias alike.

   At the start of his new mission, General Petraeus made it clear that
   military means alone could not deliver success. Politics would have to
   play its part. But Iraq's sectarian parties have not agreed to share
   power and wealth in a way that might draw the conflict's poison.
   America's Congress has set out a series of "benchmarks" for Iraq's
   government, such as ensuring that the oil-poor Sunni provinces get a
   fair share of revenues and letting former Baathists back into
   government jobs. But Congress's Government Accountability Office
   reported this week that, of 18 benchmarks, Iraq had met only three in
   full and four in part. The NIE's assessment is that over the next six
   to 12 months Mr Maliki's government will become even more precarious
   as sectarian splits deepen.

   In Anbar Mr Bush raised the prospect of withdrawing some troops, but
   only "based on a calm assessment by our military commanders on the
   conditions on the ground--not a nervous reaction by Washington
   politicians." The calm General Petraeus later confirmed in a TV
   interview that some scaling back of the surge was probable. This,
   however, was always expected. America's ground forces are under
   unprecedented strain, and the longer the extra troops stay the more
   the generals worry that the all-volunteer army will "break". Frontline
   units are already serving their third or fourth battle tours, and
   their deployments have been extended to 15 months with only a year at
   home to recuperate (British forces serve six-month tours, with two
   years at home). Continuing the surge beyond next spring would mean
   either extending tours beyond 15 months, or calling up more soldiers
   from the National Guard and reserves, or both.

   The election at home

   American politicians are hardly less divided than Iraq's. With only 14
   months until the next election, polls matter. Mr Bush will never have
   to face the voters again, but the other players in Washington--members
   of Congress and candidates for the presidency--think of little else.

   Most Democrats in Congress want to pull America out of Iraq as soon as
   is practical. Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, spoke for many
   earlier this year when he said the war was lost. In theory, Congress
   can force a pull-out by denying Mr Bush the funds to continue
   fighting. But that is harder than it sounds. For obvious political
   reasons, the Democrats cannot simply cut off the funds that keep
   American soldiers properly supplied and equipped in the field. They
   can try to pass war-funding bills with strings attached--such as a
   demand for withdrawal by a certain date. But they need 60 votes (out
   of 100) in the Senate to get past a Republican filibuster, and they do
   not have them.

   To woo wavering Republicans, some Democrats are elasticating their
   deadlines. Carl Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
   Committee, who sponsors a bill calling for a withdrawal to begin
   within 120 days, leaving a limited presence by April 30th 2008, says
   he might drop the end-date if that allows the bill to pass. Anti-war
   activists seethe at such compromises, but Democratic leaders in
   Congress retort that they have to be pragmatic.

   For Democrats vying for the party's presidential nomination, the
   calculation is different. To win the nomination, a candidate must
   appeal to the kind of hard-core Democrats who vote in primaries, who
   tend to be furiously anti-war. Some pander without reservation. Bill
   Richardson demands that Congress "de-authorise" the war. John Edwards
   dismissed Mr Bush's trip to Anbar this week as a "photo op" and
   downplayed any progress there by noting that Anbar is "a homogeneous
   area that lacks the ethnic conflict that's plaguing the rest of the
   country." He demanded that Congress confront the president over Iraq:
   "No timeline, no funding. No excuses."

   Others are more circumspect. Hillary Clinton, the favourite to win the
   Democratic nomination, said last month that the new tactics seemed to
   be working in some provinces, such as Anbar. She favours "beginning"
   to bring the troops home, but is careful not to make detailed promises
   that might tie her hands. This may be because she expects to win, and
   to have to oversee America's endgame in Iraq.

   Republican presidential candidates tend to support Mr Bush and the
   surge, but among the big-hitters only John McCain says much about it
   on the campaign trail. Mr McCain called for extra troops long before
   they were sent, so Mr Bush's conversion to his point of view counts as
   a triumph of sorts for the senator from Arizona. But his loud
   association with an unpopular war makes him all but unelectable. His
   main rivals, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson, emphasise
   how tough they will be on terrorists but say as little as possible
   about Iraq.

   Run and hope for the best?

   What if America cut its losses and left altogether now? ("Now"
   actually means over the many months, or perhaps a year, it would take
   to remove all its forces, contractors and their paraphernalia.) A few
   advocates of early withdrawal claim that by announcing its departure
   America would galvanise Iraqi politicians into making the painful but
   necessary power-sharing compromises they have so far been able to
   avoid. Barry Posen, director of security studies at the Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology, was arguing more than a year ago that the
   occupation was "infantilising" Iraq's politics. But most advocates of
   leaving acknowledge that conditions in Iraq would probably get worse.

   In December 2006 the Iraq Study Group chaired by James Baker and Lee
   Hamilton suggested that most of America's soldiers could leave by the
   first quarter of 2008, even though a "precipitate" withdrawal could
   lead to more violence, a power vacuum, regional instability and the
   intervention of neighbours. Many independent analysts have since come
   to agree. In February Steven Simon, a former member of America's
   National Security Council, produced a report for the Council on
   Foreign Relations, arguing that since America would not be able to
   stop Iraq's civil wars by staying on, it should announce a plan for a
   "military disengagement" over a period of 12 to 18 months.

   Mr Simon does not expect the violence to become less intense once
   America begins to leave, but thinks a Sunni-Shia military stalemate
   would be a likelier outcome than the wholesale expulsion or genocide
   of the Sunnis. That, he says, is because the Shias show little
   interest in conquering the Sunni areas, and because neither side has
   the aircraft, heavy artillery or armour to reduce cities to rubble and
   so inflict truly massive casualties. But most truly awful recent wars
   (Congo, Rwanda) were fought mainly with small arms. Toby Dodge, a
   well-respected Iraq-watcher at London's International Institute for
   Strategic Studies, has argued that the growing conventional
   wisdom--"run away and hope for the best"--would lead to a lethal
   free-for-all and a collapse into warlordism.

   Needless to say, proponents of early withdrawal do not characterise
   their approach as just hoping for the best. They think that by taking
   care over the timing and manner of its departure America may still be
   able to shape events and diminish the chances of leaving mayhem
   behind. In Mr Simon's plan, for example, America would continue to
   give Iraq aid and training and keep troops nearby so they could
   intervene if a genocide really did unfold. The Centre for American
   Progress proposes a "phased consolidation": American troops would
   withdraw from the most stable bits of Iraq first, to avoid leaving "a
   sudden and immediate power vacuum".

   Such plans may include too much wishful thinking. In June Senator
   Richard Lugar, a senior Republican who believes the war has failed,
   said America ought to leave in a way that prevented Iraq becoming a
   haven for terrorists, safeguarded regional stability, prevented
   Iranian domination of the area and limited the damage to America's
   reputation. That is a lot to ask from a withdrawing army. In Basra,
   the British forces who withdrew this week from the palace to the
   airport found themselves incapable of shaping events in the city once
   their numbers dwindled below the level at which they could impose
   their will on the streets (see [5]article).

   If the main affliction of Iraq is a sectarian civil war, might
   partition be the solution? In his June speech Mr Lugar said that "few
   Iraqis have demonstrated that they want to be Iraqis". With the
   half-exception of the Kurds, however, Iraq does not lend itself to
   neat division. More than half of its population lives in four mixed
   cities, Baghdad, Basra, Mosul and Kirkuk. It is true that if ethnic
   cleansing continues for long enough (a large proportion of its
   minority populations has already been displaced), Iraq may end up
   breaking into Sunni, Shia and Kurdish mini-states. But to produce such
   an outcome by consent would require Iraq's mistrustful politicians to
   make heroic decisions on where to draw borders and how to share the
   oil.

   Mr Lugar's assessment of what Iraqis want may anyway be wrong. A
   series of opinion surveys conducted by Mansoor Moaddel, who is
   affiliated with Eastern Michigan University and the University of
   Michigan Institute for Social Research, has found that Iraqi Arabs, if
   not the Kurds, have a strong sense of national identity. Though
   sectarian conflict is increasing, he says, "It would be a mistake to
   think that this bloodlust represents widespread sentiment among Iraqis
   as a whole. While neither American nor Iraqi security officials have
   yet found a way to tame the militias, the Iraqi public is increasingly
   drawn toward a vision of a democratic, non-sectarian government for
   the country."

   Strategic ju-jitsu

   Almost all advocates of early withdrawal stress the desirability of
   co-operation with Iraq's neighbours. The Baker-Hamilton report said
   that America needed to reach out to Iran and Syria, America's
   adversaries. Since May American diplomats have twice met their Iranian
   counterparts to discuss security in Iraq, but these meetings have so
   far achieved little. The Americans say that Iran is helping its Shia
   allies in Iraq to attack American soldiers. The Iranians deny this but
   make no secret of wanting to humble the superpower in Iraq, if only to
   deter it from attacking them too.

   It has become a commonplace to point out that America's invasion of
   Iraq has strengthened Iran. With Saddam dead and a friendly Shia
   government in Baghdad, the mullahs in Tehran are showing a new
   self-confidence. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, says
   that America is "stuck in a whirlpool" and sinking deeper. Iran's
   president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, adds that Iran is ready to fill the
   vacuum.

   Even after leaving Iraq America would have strategic interests in the
   energy-rich Middle East. To reassure allies, Mr Bush has beefed up
   American naval forces in the Persian Gulf and promised to provide
   nervous Sunni Arab regimes (and Israel) with dollops of advanced
   weaponry over the coming decade. On top of this the Americans are
   trying to block Iran's fishy-looking nuclear programme by imposing
   economic sanctions, both directly and through the UN Security Council.

                                                                       AP

                                     AP

                    It's been nice knowing you--sort of

   There is another school of thought. Some analysts see Iran as a
   country that is as keen as America to avoid chaos in Iraq and so can
   be enlisted as a helper. William Lind of the Free Congress Foundation
   argues that America should get out and let a pro-Iranian strongman
   such as Muqtada al-Sadr re-establish strong central authority. Such an
   Iraq would not be a pro-American state but it would at least be a
   state. Others advocate an American rapprochement with Iran similar to
   the opening Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger made to China as cover
   for leaving Vietnam.

   In any such attempt at strategic ju-jitsu, however, America's
   bargaining position will in the end depend on a combination of
   military strength and political will. Mr Bush's message from Anbar
   this week seemed to be that America could escape from its Iraqi trap
   only by making itself look strong again before getting out. General
   Petraeus has to persuade Congress that such a plan is still possible.


   Iraq's Kurdish soldiers have been welcomed in parts of Baghdad

                                                                      AFP
                                                                      AFP

                                                A Kurd with an Iraqi flag


   BRISTLING with weapons, the men arrived on the back of three pick-up
   trucks, then surrounded the modest house in the once "mixed" suburb of
   al-Amel, in western Baghdad. A black-clad gunman jumped down and
   hammered on the thin metal gate. There were "bad people" on the loose,
   he shouted to the residents cowering inside. They should pack up and
   go and live "among your own people--for your own protection". He and
   his men would helpfully put their belongings on the back of the
   trucks. For safety's sake, the family should go immediately. As this
   ultimatum was being given to the terrified Sunni Arab family by the
   Shia gunmen, a group of Iraqi policemen, also Shias, leant on a police
   car and idly puffed away on their cigarettes, just 50 yards up the
   street, indifferent to the crime of sectarian cleansing being
   perpetrated under their noses.

   That scene has become all too common in al-Amel--and in many other
   mixed districts. Since the bombing of the Shias' shrine in Samarra,
   north of Baghdad, in February last year, many mixed and middle-class
   areas have become either mostly Shia or mostly Sunni, depending on
   which side of the main road you live.

   Yet on the occasion described above the Sunni family managed to sit
   tight, in the house they had built some 30 years ago in what was then
   a palm grove. They were saved by the arrival, in the nick of time, of
   a contingent of about 100 Kurdish soldiers, some of the 3,000-odd
   former peshmerga fighters (literally, "those who face death") who have
   joined Iraq's national army and have been controversially deployed in
   Baghdad as part of the "surge" of troops, mainly American ones, to
   beef up security in the bloody capital.

   As they neared the besieged house, the Kurdish soldiers shot over the
   heads of the Shia gunmen, identified by locals as members of the Mahdi
   militia loyal to a Shia firebrand, Muqtada al-Sadr, and told them to
   leave the area. They swiftly complied. There was no American soldier
   in sight.

   It is still too soon to say, three months after the surge began,
   whether it is working. Only about half the promised extra 22,000-plus
   American troops earmarked for Baghdad have arrived. Sectarian murders,
   mainly of Sunnis by Shia militias, are fewer; but bombings, including
   suicide ones, by Sunni- and al-Qaeda-linked insurgents, are more
   frequent. The overall death toll is down a bit but is still horrific.

   But in the mixed areas of the capital where Kurdish troops
   incorporated into the national army have been deployed, residents and
   American officers notice a definite drop in sectarian cleansing and
   violence. People's confidence in the security forces, they say, has
   improved. In al-Amel more shops are opening up again; a semblance of
   normal daily life has resumed. Some expelled Sunni and Shia families,
   though still just a trickle, have returned.

   "The Kurds are welcomed here by the people," says a Sunni Arab in
   al-Amel. "They want to restore order. They are more polite than the
   Americans and not as dangerous as the Shia militias." General Nazir
   Goran, a Kurd who commands an Iraqi army brigade in the capital, says
   that his men have been operating effectively in some of the capital's
   "hot zones", mainly in western Baghdad. But they still feel obliged to
   avoid the areas of eastern Baghdad controlled by the Sadrists.

   In any case, the first loyalty of the Kurds inducted into the national
   army is to their Kurdish homeland and its regional government, not to
   the Iraqi state. Iraqis of all stripes generally reckon that the Iraqi
   army is less under the influence of Shia groups than are the police,
   which have been heavily infiltrated by Shia militiamen. Most army
   recruits are Shias and Kurds; less than a tenth of the officers are
   Sunnis.

   The decision to send Kurdish units of the Iraqi army to Baghdad was
   controversial in Kurdistan. Many Kurds worry that the deployment will
   drag them into the sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia Arabs.
   Other Kurds say, "It's not our battle." But so far they have been
   welcomed by a surprising number of Iraqi Arabs, even though they have
   often viewed the Kurds as a threat to Iraq's fragile unity.


   Jobs and corruption are the issues in a close-fought contest to be
   president 

                                                                  Reuters

                                  Reuters

   EVEN by the colourful standards of African politicians, Raila Odinga
   stands out. The son of Kenya's first vice-president, Oginga Odinga, Mr
   Odinga was educated in East Germany and spent six years in solitary
   confinement for his alleged involvement in a 1982 coup that failed to
   topple the president of the day, Daniel arap Moi. Later, Mr Odinga was
   rehabilitated. Enriched by his family's molasses business, he helped
   to defeat Mr Moi in the presidential election of 2002, this time by
   throwing his support behind a coalition led by Mwai Kibaki. Now he is
   campaigning to topple Mr Kibaki and become president himself in the
   election due on December 27th. And because the mirror of Kenyan
   politics reverses everything sooner or later, the retired Mr Moi is
   backing Mr Kibaki.

   Mr Odinga wants to build more roads and modernise Kenya's railways. He
   calls the failure to add an inch of track to the railway system since
   independence from Britain in 1963, "a strong statement about the
   mediocrity with which this country has been run". He is also keen on
   devolution. A recent visit to Wales convinced him that a Welsh-style
   assembly would work for Kenya's regions. As an ethnic Luo, Mr Odinga
   is proud of his friendship with Barack Obama, an American presidential
   candidate whose father was also Luo.

   Still, Mr Odinga makes many queasy. Bankers fret about his Marxist
   youth. Foreign diplomats suspect him of authoritarian tendencies. For
   better or worse, a victory for this ebullient German-speaker would
   certainly upset the cosy country-club politics that have characterised
   Kenya since independence. Although he is rich, he remains an outsider.

   Mr Kibaki, by contrast, is an insider. A minister since 1965, he has a
   reputation for good manners. He enjoys playing golf and reads P.G.
   Wodehouse novels. Despite these gentle pursuits, his health is a
   worry. Some say he is unable to work hard; he occasionally nods off
   while conducting important government business. He rejected a call by
   Mr Odinga for a televised presidential debate. That said, he has
   performed gamely on the campaign trail. He opposes devolution. He has
   the solid backing of the Catholic church and of Kenya's business
   class. Under his presidency, the country is better educated, less
   authoritarian, more prosperous and better connected to the world
   (notably China) than it has ever been.

   On December 18th, in the last test of opinion before the election,
   Steadman, a local polling firm, put Mr Odinga at 45%, against 43% for
   Mr Kibaki and 10% for Kalonzo Musyoka, a former foreign minister and
   born-again Christian who has designs on winning a future presidential
   election. If those numbers hold, Mr Odinga's Orange Democratic
   Movement should also do well in the parliamentary elections, ahead of
   Mr Kibaki's umbrella Party of National Unity. A further threat to Mr
   Kibaki is that he may not achieve the mandatory 25% in five of the
   country's eight provinces, which would disqualify him. He is already
   known to be doing badly in Western, Coast and North-Eastern provinces,
   where he is having to do more campaigning than he wants.

   If Mr Kibaki does lose, it will be because he has not created enough
   jobs. Despite an overvalued Kenyan shilling, tourism and agriculture
   are booming. The economy is growing at about 6% a year, a record. But
   Mr Kibaki has not fulfilled his dream of turning Kenya into an
   industrialised country.

   He may also be punished for his failure to tackle egregious
   corruption, a central pledge from his 2002 victory. His own appointee
   in charge of ethics in the government, John Githongo, was bullied into
   exile after uncovering massive fraud within the government. Mr
   Githongo says that the president first ignored and then "flat-out
   opposed me". Under intense pressure from donors Mr Kibaki removed two
   ministers accused of corruption, only to reappoint them a few months
   later. But there is little expectation that Mr Odinga would do much
   better in this respect. Only Mr Musyoka has set a leader's example by
   making his assets and income public.

   In many ways, the young hold the key. Mr Odinga has a massive lead
   among twenty-somethings. If they bother to vote, change is certain.
   The integrity of the voting process will be tested to breaking point.
   Screaming mobs, mostly of jobless young men, will surely use any
   irregularities to make trouble. Kenyans hope that a fiercely fought
   election will forge a truer democracy, not cause more bloodshed.


   The ruling party's leadership race turns into a depressing duel

   IN MANY democratic countries, party leadership contests are openly
   fought affairs. In South Africa's ruling African National Congress
   (ANC), they have usually been a lot more mysterious. Candidates deny
   they are in the running--so do not debate with one another--and there
   is only one name left on the ballot by the time the party votes. But
   as the ANC meets on December 16th to pick its next leader, a real
   contest is in the offing for the first time in decades. Thabo Mbeki,
   president of both the ANC and the country, and Jacob Zuma, the party's
   vice-president whom Mr Mbeki sacked as the country's deputy president
   in 2005, are vying for the job. The mere fact of an open race should
   be good news. But the two candidates are not.

   Nominations from the party branches put Mr Zuma comfortably ahead, so
   he looks set to win. But Mr Mbeki's camp still hopes to convince
   enough delegates to change their minds. Ministers and other
   heavyweights have been dispatched to the local trenches. Allegations
   of wrongdoing on both sides, from promises of jobs and cash to
   intimidation and shenanigans in the course of nomination, have been
   flying around too. The constitution bars Mr Mbeki from being the
   country's president for a third term after the 2009 general election.
   But if he retains control of the party, he can at least block Mr Zuma
   from following him, as the party's president traditionally becomes its
   candidate to be the country's president.

   However, after 13 years in power, first as Nelson Mandela's deputy and
   then as president, Mr Mbeki's aloof and authoritarian style of
   leadership has alienated many in the party. Parts of the ANC, together
   with the party's communist and trade union allies, are unhappy with
   the government's economic policies, which they criticise as too
   business-friendly and not helpful enough to the country's many poor.
   And they complain that the party's tradition of robust debate has been
   replaced by fear and intolerance. Mr Mbeki's stubbornly weird views on
   HIV/AIDS have also angered many.

   All this has boosted the fortunes of the congenial Mr Zuma, far more
   at ease with the party's rank and file than Mr Mbeki. To allay fears
   that he may be too radical, he has recently been waltzing through
   Asia, Europe and America, telling investors that he supports the
   government's broadly free-market policies. In other words, they have
   nothing to fear if he becomes South Africa's president.

   But Mr Zuma is hardly an ideal candidate. He was sacked in 2005
   following the conviction of his financial adviser for corruption and
   could soon face similar charges himself. He was acquitted of rape in
   2006, but admitted to having unprotected sex with his HIV-positive
   accuser; he said he took a shower to minimise the risks of infection.
   Mr Zuma believes he is the innocent victim of a political conspiracy,
   but his detractors accuse him of saying whatever people want to hear
   and of surrounding himself with shady characters. They still fear that
   he may reverse the undoubted gains of recent years with reckless
   economic policies.

   Unfortunately, hopes for a compromise candidate seem dead. A former
   Robben Island prisoner and successful businessman, Tokyo Sexwale,
   threw his hat in the ring but failed to get much support. He is now
   supporting Mr Zuma. Other credible alternatives, such as Cyril
   Ramaphosa, a former trade unionist and now businessman, have kept
   their heads down.

   Is there no one else?

   The rest of South Africa is watching from the sidelines--and is
   unimpressed. According to local polls taken in the big cities, Mr
   Mbeki's popularity has sunk to 40%, while almost half think that a
   Zuma presidency would be disastrous.

   Whatever happens, it seems that the days are gone when the ANC leader
   simply emerged from a magic circle of party elders. Some ANC voices
   lament this, arguing that the open and public bitterness of the
   current contest is a betrayal of the party's collegial traditions.

   But a more open and competitive leadership race should in theory be a
   step in the right direction for both the party and the country, as the
   official opposition, now led by a white liberal, Helen Zille, is
   unlikely to present much of an electoral challenge for the foreseeable
   future. It is, however, hard to fathom how a party with such a long
   line of remarkable leaders has ended up having to choose between these
   particular alternatives.


   Israelis are enjoying calm and prosperity but worried about the future

   THIS May, Israelis will look back over their country's 60 years of
   history with mixed feelings. To be sure, they (or their parents and
   grandparents) built a state from scratch, and it has prospered
   relative to its neighbours. Israel's GDP per head is around four times
   bigger, at purchasing-power parity, than the Arab world's, even
   including the oil-rich Gulf states, and the country has changed a lot
   more too. Almost gone are national stereotypes like the sunburned,
   sandalled kibbutznik and the family at Tel Aviv's airport arguing with
   a customs official over a mountain of foreign-bought gadgets and
   gifts; they can now buy most of the same stuff at home, even if it
   still costs a bit more.

   Israel has also bounced back from the Palestinians' second intifada,
   which began in 2000 and has gradually died down. The barrier being
   built in the West Bank and an aggressive strategy against Palestinian
   militants have helped, along with a truce, to make suicide bombings a
   rarity. Though a constant drizzle of home-made rockets fired from Gaza
   keeps the residents of nearby Israeli towns living in fear, most other
   Israelis just shrug.

   But although they find the present quite comfortable, it is a long
   time since they felt so unsure about the future. Few expect peace with
   the Palestinians. Tough security measures may keep the human cost to
   Israel down, but more Israelis now realise that their mighty army, so
   good at fighting conventional battles, has no answer to the rockets
   from Gaza or to Hizbullah's well-equipped guerrillas across the border
   in Lebanon, should another war break out like the one in 2006.
   Security hawks alarm Israelis with the prospect of an Iranian nuclear
   bomb as the first real existential threat in Israel's history.
   Israelis with a European parent or grandparent who never thought of
   leaving before have been taking out second passports--just in case.

   They also disagree more and more about what kind of country they want
   to live in. Arab Israelis, a fifth of the citizenry, are reacting to
   decades of discrimination by demanding more rights and recognition as
   a minority. Few feel that the 60th anniversary of the state whose
   birth marked their separation from other Palestinians will be anything
   to celebrate.

   But divisions are widening among Jews too. As the religious population
   expands and a younger, more fundamentalist religious generation comes
   of age, secular and religious Jews are becoming more segregated in
   some areas. Some secular Jews fear becoming a minority. And
   secular-religious conflicts over what the Jewish nature of the state
   should be, as well as what to do with the territories occupied since
   1967, have become ever fiercer.


   Peace in the south, war in the west and poverty amid riches

                                                                       AP
                                                                       AP

                                                Bashir the great survivor


   THE presidential pardon given to Gillian Gibbons, a British
   schoolteacher who was briefly jailed for allowing her pupils to name
   the class teddy-bear Muhammad, proves how mature and responsible
   Sudan's government is. Such is the solemn opinion of a senior Sudanese
   official.

   Some Sudanese may join in imagining that their country emerged well
   from the teddy-bear affair (although a few sword-waving hotheads now
   blame the state for failing to defend Islam against such blasphemy).
   But to many in this crisis-prone country, as well as to a hissing
   chorus of Muslim commentators elsewhere, the business looked more like
   an embarrassing symptom of sickly xenophobia or, perhaps, an act of
   base demagoguery. In fact, both views, benign and malevolent, are
   probably true. As with so many other aspects of Africa's biggest and
   most turbulent state, it all depends on how you look at things.

   The Islamist regime of General Omar al-Bashir is brutal. For 15 years
   it pursued a vicious jihad against largely non-Muslim rebels in the
   south, then armed and goaded tribesmen in the west to attack rival
   ethnic groups, generating the Darfur tragedy that has left some
   300,000 people dead. Mr Bashir's inflammatory rhetoric and often
   mulish resistance to humanitarian pleading have made Sudan a pariah,
   at least in the West. His hounding of dissidents, corrupt cronyism,
   lack of interest in the poor and favouritism for the capital at the
   expense of the provinces have hardly made him popular at home, either.

   Yet this same regime signed a treaty in 2005 that ended fighting with
   the south, Africa's longest war. It thereby committed itself to
   sharing power and revenue with foes who are hardly angels themselves,
   and to a democratic transition that could yet prove a model for the
   continent. Furthermore, Mr Bashir's government has retreated from the
   fundamentalist fervour unleashed by his 1989 coup. It is hard to
   imagine another Arab capital hosting Christian revivalist meetings in
   its biggest football stadium, as Khartoum does. Unlike some
   neighbouring dictatorships, Sudan's tolerates a lively press,
   opposition parties and the presence of thousands of foreign aid
   workers. It has also survived longer than any regime since Sudan
   gained independence in 1956.

   That longevity owes much to the way that Mr Bashir has cleverly split
   the differences in his often-divided government. Thus, for instance,
   on Darfur the representatives of the more hardline intelligence and
   security ministries, such as Nafie Ali Nafie, have always wanted a
   military solution regardless of the world's sensibilities. The more
   moderate ministers, such as the vice-president, Ali Osman Taha, argue
   that ending Sudan's diplomatic isolation is more important than
   winning the war. The two wings are ascendant at different times, and
   Mr Bashir oscillates between them. It gives Mr Bashir a useful degree
   of ideological flexibility and keeps Western diplomats nicely
   off-balance as well.

   Some officials readily admit to many mistakes in Darfur, and regret
   the carnage. They point in mitigation to such goodwill gestures as
   granting free admission to state universities for students from
   Darfur, and note that it was the rebel parties, not the government,
   which failed to show up for recent peace talks. Even Western diplomats
   plead that much of what appears to be stalling on, for example, the
   deployment of a UN peacekeeping force, has to do with legitimate
   concerns for maintaining sovereignty. But the bald fact remains that
   Khartoum instigated the killing and continues to obstruct the
   peacekeepers.

   Mr Bashir's survival has also been helped by an economic boom, at
   least in Khartoum. The past five years have seen property prices
   quadruple in the capital, the number of cars double and more companies
   started than in the previous 75 years. Oil revenues are pushing $4
   billion a year and economic growth tops 10%. Even in the destitute
   south, a region virtually devoid of infrastructure, the share of oil
   revenues enjoyed by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), the
   former rebel group that now runs this autonomous region, is larger
   than the national budgets of similar-sized African nations. Yet most
   Sudanese beyond the capital remain dismally poor, and the country's
   natural potential, especially in agriculture, remains hugely
   under-exploited.

   The obstinacy of the government over a few divisive issues presents a
   perpetual risk to the north-south peace accord. In October the SPLM
   pulled its ministers out of the national-unity government. Talks are
   under way to redress their grievances. But if differences linger, and
   the careful schedule that provides for elections in 2009 and a
   referendum on southern independence in 2011 begins to slip much
   further, Sudan could find itself sliding back into a swamp deeper even
   than Darfur's.


   Elections could further destabilise the violent, oil-rich Delta region


   THE seedy drinking-holes frequented by burly foreign oilmen in
   Nigeria's main oil city of Port Harcourt are pretty empty these days.
   Kidnappings and killings of expatriate workers, car-bombs and violent
   robberies have persuaded many to stay behind the high walls and barbed
   wire of their own homes, as armed groups wreak havoc ahead of national
   elections next month.

   In the past year, attacks on oil facilities have forced Nigeria to
   shut down a fifth of its production; over 100 foreign workers have
   been kidnapped in the oil-producing Niger Delta region. Higher
   security costs and a shrinking number of expatriates willing to take
   the risks of working there have sharply slowed new investment. The
   Nigerian government has lost billions of dollars in oil revenues. Now
   the multinational oil companies, such as Royal Dutch Shell, that
   operate in Africa's biggest oil producer are bracing themselves for
   more trouble. The omens are not good; in the run-up to the elections
   in 2003, violence in the Delta forced Nigeria to shut down 40% of its
   oil capacity.

   Trouble in the region is not a new phenomenon, but it has escalated in
   the past year or so. For years, impoverished communities in the
   tropical swamplands of the Delta protested against exploitation of
   their lands by oil companies, only to be suppressed by the army.
   Things got worse under civilian rule in the late 1990s, when
   politicians armed local thugs to rig elections for them. After the
   2003 elections, many of these bully-boys used their guns in
   territorial squabbles in the mangrove creeks. But they also began to
   espouse a radical political rhetoric as well, demanding a greater
   share of the oil-wealth for their local communities. In the cities,
   criminal gangs, born from secretive university fraternities, were
   armed in a similar way.

   Militant cells and gang leaders are engaged in a variety of criminal
   enterprises, building up arsenals of weapons with the proceeds and
   sometimes working with corrupt army officials. The theft of crude oil
   from sophisticated oil pipelines and wells (known as "bunkering") has
   become a multi-million-dollar industry. Worryingly, the Movement for
   the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), the mysterious group
   responsible for the most troubling attacks on the oil industry last
   year, has been trying to bridge the gap between militants in the
   creeks, with their machine-guns and rocket-launchers, and the criminal
   gangs in the cities, armed with lighter Kalashnikov rifles.

   On January 28th MEND stormed a police complex in Port Harcourt,
   freeing 125 criminals, including Soboma George, an influential gang
   leader who had once been used to help rig state elections for the
   ruling party. MEND's anonymous leader and spokesman boasts that he has
   "the oil industry by the balls". On March 15th, after releasing its
   latest two hostages, presumably for a nice ransom, MEND promised to
   step up its attacks.

   But many groups falling under the broad banner of MEND have local
   agendas and a variety of paymasters. Some have been enraged by the
   choice of gubernatorial candidates put up by the ruling People's
   Democratic Party (PDP) which may well cheat, rig and bribe its way
   into hanging onto power in the Delta State Houses in April's
   elections. The richest oil-producing states have revenues of up to
   $1.3 billion a year but dismal records in providing basic services,
   since officials loot most of the money. The fear is that militants
   could work alone or with MEND to disrupt elections in the Delta states
   and launch attacks on the oil industry as a way of holding the PDP
   state and federal governments to ransom. "Either bodies are going to
   pile up or we are going to see an oil shock, or both," says an
   oil-industry security official.

   The PDP candidate for president, Umaru Yar'Adua, a northern state
   governor, says that by picking as his running-mate Goodluck Jonathan,
   from the Delta's majority tribe, the Ijaw, he will be able to tackle
   the region's problems. Should he become vice-president, Mr Jonathan
   will be under pressure to deliver quick results to his people if he
   wants to stave off yet more violence and unrest in his land.


   A doughty fighter of corruption is sent away for re-education 


   NIGERIANS are painfully aware of how much corruption has cost their
   country--over $400 billion, according to official estimates. That is
   the equivalent of about two-thirds of all the aid given to the whole
   of Africa since the 1960s, and more than anything else explains why
   most people in this oil-rich country still live in poverty.

   Yet in recent years the government had started a belated fight against
   corruption. And if one man has become the symbol of that campaign it
   is the crusading young head of the Economic and Financial Crimes
   Commission (EFCC), Nuhu Ribadu. Since 2003, Mr Ribadu has attained
   almost mythic status among his countrymen by charging and prosecuting
   the politicians, and particularly the state governors, who are
   responsible for most of the fraud and looting of public funds. For the
   first time, he gave Nigerians hope that their country could actually
   be different. So the news on December 27th that Mr Ribadu is being
   forced to resign on a technicality has caused deep dismay among his
   supporters. It is also very worrying for the future of Africa's most
   populous country.

   In short, Mr Ribadu finally got too close to the top. His
   anti-corruption agency, once accused of prosecuting only the
   government's political foes, has under the new president, Umaru
   Yar'Adua, been pursuing the former state governors who lost their
   immunity from prosecution after leaving office last May. He had some
   big successes. The EFCC has arrested seven governors, including two of
   the most notorious, Ayo Fayose of Ekiti State and James Ibori of Delta
   State, both of whom spent Christmas in prison. Another round of
   arrests was planned for early January.

   The prosecution of Mr Ibori was the boldest. The former governor of
   the oil-rich Delta State received a salary of less than $25,000 a
   year. Last August a court in London ordered a freeze on $35m of his
   worldwide assets. Despite this, he was thought to be untouchable in
   Nigeria because of his political connections. He is a prominent leader
   of the ruling People's Democratic Party and was a major funder of Mr
   Yar'Adua's election campaign. So when Mr Ibori was arrested on
   December 12th many Nigerians gasped--and then cheered. Among other
   charges against him was an attempted $15m bribe of the EFCC to drop
   the case against him. "He didn't realise that it was being recorded,"
   said a commission official.

   It was also the arrest of Mr Ibori, however, that tipped the scales
   against Mr Ribadu. Two weeks later came the announcement that Mr
   Ribadu would have to resign to attend a one-year course of study at
   the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies in Jos.
   Technically, a man of Mr Ribadu's senior rank has to have done this as
   part of his qualifications; the head of the police said that the
   "transfer" was only to make Mr Ribadu "a better officer". In fact, Mr
   Ribadu could probably teach the course himself; the former president,
   Olusegun Obasanjo, did not insist on it. In any case, few are in any
   doubt as to the real reason for Mr Ribadu's sudden obligation to go
   back to school. Nervous former state governors pressured--and
   blackmailed--Mr Yar'Adua into letting the police chief sack Mr Ribadu
   to spare them any more prosecutions.

   For, right now, Mr Yar'Adua needs all the political support he can
   get. The president is soon to face a legal challenge to his own
   election in a tribunal. He cannot afford to lose friends--and the
   ex-governors are among the strongest in his People's Democratic Party.
   They also have the president's ear because several of them, not least
   Mr Ibori, could probably produce damning evidence of the widespread
   election rigging that brought the president to office.

   Yet sidelining the head of the EFCC in this way is terrible news for
   Nigeria. The commission is popular--the second most trusted
   institution in the country, according to a 2007 poll. The agency's
   more than 200 convictions over four years have resurrected
   international confidence in the country. With a soaring stockmarket,
   investors have poured into Nigeria in the hope that the country was at
   last getting on top of its problems, such as corruption. Now some of
   that progress is at risk.

   For Mr Ribadu, there may still be a way out. He could resign. Or he
   could refuse to go until the orders come directly from the president.
   That would leave room for Mr Yar'Adua to back down, and save himself
   as well. But if Mr Ribadu is forced out, as Chris Albin-Lackey of
   Human Rights Watch, a lobby group, puts it, "the message is
   unmistakable. The credibility of the EFCC and the president, someone
   who is genuinely interested in fighting corruption, will be
   destroyed."


   The opposition's surprising acceptance of Robert Mugabe's latest
   clever move

   ROBERT MUGABE appears once again to have wrong-footed those who have
   been trying to oust him. Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown, is
   trying to prevent Zimbabwe's president from attending a much-heralded
   summit meeting of the African Union and the European Union in
   December. Mr Brown says he will not attend if Mr Mugabe does. But it
   seems clear that most African governments will stay away if Mr Mugabe
   is excluded. Portugal, the summit's host, is apparently likely to bow
   to African pressure and hold the summit whether or not Mr Brown shows
   up. And British officials hint that even if Mr Brown stayed away,
   other ministers would almost certainly attend.

   Better still for Mr Mugabe, both factions of Zimbabwe's divided
   opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), have recently
   sided with the ruling party, ZANU-PF, endorsing some controversial
   constitutional amendments that may well strengthen its grip. This has
   dismayed many of the lobbies--human-rights campaigners, churches,
   women's groups and so on--that usually back the MDC, further
   fracturing an already crumbly opposition.

   The amendments proposed by the ruling party allow Parliament, which is
   dominated by ZANU-PF, to choose a successor if the president steps
   down or dies before the end of his term. Simultaneous parliamentary
   and presidential elections look set for March 2008. Seats in the lower
   house will increase from 150 to 210, and constituencies will be
   redrawn. This will favour rural areas, where ZANU-PF's grip is tighter
   than in the towns. The ruling party gave ground by agreeing to limit
   the president's power to appoint some members of parliament; a
   supposedly revamped electoral commission will be in charge of
   redrawing constituencies.

   Until now, the MDC had strongly opposed the amendments on the ground
   that they would entrench the ruling party ahead of the election. The
   MDC had insisted on a new constitution, the repeal of repressive
   security and media laws, and for Zimbabwe's diaspora, thought to be
   more than 3m-strong, to be allowed to vote. Some pro-reform
   organisations are aghast at the MDC'S reversal. The National
   Constitutional Assembly, a lobby that for a decade has called for a
   new constitution, accuses its former ally of treachery.

   For its part, the MDC calls its volte-face a confidence-building
   gesture. It has been talking to ZANU-PF under the auspices of Thabo
   Mbeki, South Africa's president, who was asked in March by the
   14-country Southern African Development Community (SADC) to help solve
   Zimbabwe's crisis. Behind its official policy of united support for Mr
   Mugabe, the regional grouping is divided. The British say that a
   change of mood was noticeable at the latest SADC summit, in Lusaka in
   August, and that countries like Tanzania and even Namibia that were
   previously loth to challenge Mr Mugabe have begun to see his refusal
   to budge as damaging the whole region.

   So SADC has hailed the constitutional deal as a breakthrough.
   Enthusiasts point to reports that ZANU-PF may relax (though not
   repeal) the media and security laws and work towards a new
   constitution--at some stage. Some also argue that letting Mr Mugabe in
   effect pick his successor would make him likelier to step down.
   Negotiations between his party and the MDC continue, but it is unclear
   whether Mr Mugabe's lot will make serious concessions.

   Divide and rule

   The opposition is weaker than ever. It has been unable to stir up the
   millions of victims of Zimbabwe's economic catastrophe. The MDC
   faction headed by Arthur Mutambara said in July that attempts to unite
   the party and field a single presidential candidate had failed. He
   denounced Morgan Tsvangirai, the party's founder and head of the other
   faction, as "weak and indecisive". Meanwhile, many of the party's
   mostly urban supporters have left the country: in all, a quarter of
   the population may have gone. The MDC's allies look weak too. A recent
   strike call by the Congress of Trade Unions was largely ignored. Other
   groups' efforts to hold marches and protests have fizzled; people have
   long been cowed by the beatings and arrests routinely inflicted by the
   regime.

   Despite reports that the latest registration of voters was badly
   flawed, Mr Mbeki and some of his fellow leaders in the region are keen
   for next year's elections to be deemed reasonably fair, after which
   they hope that Mr Mugabe will step down and ZANU-PF will draw one of
   the MDC factions, probably the one led by Mr Mutambara rather than Mr
   Tsvangirai, into a coalition. That, they hope, will pave the way to an
   internationally-backed recovery. Whether Mr Mugabe is contemplating
   such a scenario is another matter.

   While things are getting better in much of Africa, Ethiopia risks
   getting left behind


   AS AMERICA surveys the map of eastern Africa, it finds little to take
   comfort from. Somalia is in anarchy, riven by competing warlords and a
   haven for Islamist militants. Sudan is involved in the bloody
   suppression of blacks in its western region, Darfur. Both countries
   are deaf to outside complaints and seem chronically unstable. America
   is thinking of putting Eritrea, briefly a beacon of hope after it
   split from Ethiopia in 1993, on its list of countries that sponsor
   terrorism. But between that grim trio stands Ethiopia, America's hope.

   This ancient country has become an essential ally of America in the
   "war on terror". Last year Ethiopia invaded Somalia in support of a
   UN-backed transitional federal government, which had been threatened
   with jihad by the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) that had taken over
   Mogadishu, the capital. The Americans joined in, giving vital
   intelligence, to catch al-Qaeda people whom the UIC was sheltering.
   These men, it believed, were responsible for the bombings of the
   American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, killing more than
   220 people.

   The West and Ethiopia are co-operating closely against the Islamist
   threat in the Horn of Africa, which threatens the coast of Kenya and
   Tanzania as well. It is alleged that Ethiopia is a destination for
   prisoners interrogated under the CIA's "extraordinary rendition"
   programme. Certainly the Bush administration has been unstinting in
   its praise of Meles Zenawi, the prime minister. It has also vilified
   Ethiopia's neighbour and mortal enemy, Eritrea, which it accuses,
   among other things, of arming and funding the Somali Islamists.

   Mr Zenawi won the West's friendship, too, for his efforts to tackle
   Ethiopia's deep poverty. These have met with some success--so much so
   that Tony Blair has put Mr Zenawi in the vanguard of an "African
   Renaissance". But Ethiopia's upward track as development poster-child
   and dependable ally was rudely interrupted in 2005. That year's
   presidential and parliamentary elections were marred by mass killings
   on the streets of the capital. Police fired on opposition supporters
   and others who were protesting against what they claimed were rigged
   elections. Tens of thousands, including journalists and NGO workers as
   well as opposition activists, were rounded up in a general dragnet;
   many spent weeks, or months, in prison without charge. Opposition
   leaders were accused of hugely inflated crimes, such as high treason
   and genocide. Seventy-one of them were freed only last summer, after
   having to sign a letter admitting their part in inciting violent
   protests.

   These events shattered the West's cosy image of the modernising,
   progressive Mr Zenawi. Appalled Western governments abruptly switched
   off direct financial support to the Ethiopian government, though aid
   has been resumed through indirect channels. And an anti-Zenawi lobby,
   largely funded by the big Ethiopian diaspora in America, now issues a
   stream of anti-government criticism from the United States. A few
   weeks ago the House of Representatives passed a bill condemning
   Ethiopia's human-rights record and pledging money to help opposition
   politics. Though it stands almost no chance of becoming law, it shows
   that Ethiopia is now a subject of fierce controversy.

   On six cents a day

   Ethiopia likes to do things differently. In September it started
   celebrating the new millennium (see picture above), more than seven
   years after everybody else. The country has been out of step in this
   respect since 1582: while the rest of the Christian world changed to
   the revised Gregorian calendar, Ethiopia stuck to the Julian. It also
   still keeps its own time, measured in 12-hour cycles rather than
   24-hour ones.

   Uniquely in Africa, Ethiopia was never really colonised by Europeans.
   But its singular history has been a curse as much as a blessing. As
   the rest of Africa decolonised and modernised, albeit fitfully, after
   the second world war, Ethiopia remained stuck fast in a feudal fantasy
   presided over by a diminutive emperor, Haile Selassie. He was deposed
   only in 1974, by which time the modern world had largely passed
   Ethiopia by and the country had become known for poverty and famine.
   It still is.

   Ethiopia was further damaged by the committee of military officers,
   known as the Derg, that overthrew the emperor. That regime degenerated
   into a "red terror" of gulags and summary executions; it also lost an
   expensive, wasteful war with Tigrayan and Eritrean separatists over
   what would become, in 1993, the new country of Eritrea. The Derg
   produced the dreadful famines of 1984-85, the first to be alleviated
   mainly by the efforts of Bob Geldof and a phalanx of rock stars.

   Since the early 1990s, however, Ethiopia has recovered somewhat under
   Mr Zenawi. Signs of that are evident on the big, pristine campus of
   the University of Arba Minch, more than 500km (311 miles) south of
   Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. The university's president, Tarekegn
   Tadesse, has welcomed 8,000 students this term, a huge number for an
   obscure provincial town of 50,000-odd people. The crowd of freshmen,
   he says, testifies to the government's rapid expansion of tertiary
   education; in the case of Arba Minch, enrolment has increased fourfold
   in seven years.

   It is an inspiring story. The new university buildings springing up
   all over the south are tangible evidence that the aid and development
   money pumped into Ethiopia reaches the people it is meant to. Roads
   are clearly being built, funded largely by the Chinese; schools and
   water-treatment plants are being opened. And there are few complaints
   of corruption, a fact that continues to make Ethiopia popular with
   foreign donors.

   Some of the results are encouraging, too. Infant mortality is said to
   have dropped from 141 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 123 per 1,000
   in 2005; over 70% of children are now in school, and access to clean
   water has more than doubled in ten years. Furthermore, the government
   can point to the rapid expansion of a few sectors in what is still
   mostly an agricultural economy. The great volcanic lakes of the Rift
   Valley south of the capital are now ringed by vast flower farms,
   mainly exporting to Europe. Flowers earn the country about $88m in
   exports annually, creating some 50,000 jobs in the past few years.

   Yet despite this, after almost a decade of well-intentioned
   development policies, Ethiopians remain mired in the most wretched
   poverty. Officially, about 80% of them live on less than $2 a day.
   Often it is a lot less than that. An area like Sidama, in the south,
   looks green, tropical and improbably fertile, but existence there can
   be precarious. One foreign charity, Action Contre la Faim, recently
   found that the average cash income for households in one area was six
   cents a day. Shocked researchers concluded that the depth of poverty
   there was "far beyond what had previously been thought".

   Visiting the nearby villages confirms these cold statistics. In
   Garbicho Lela, high up in the hills, a nurse estimates that 13% of
   children are severely malnourished. The one shop in the village
   betrays the low level of economic activity; on the weekly market day,
   when over 500 people will walk for hours from the surrounding
   hill-villages to sell a few things, the shop will do only about 200
   birrs ($23) of business. On an average day, it sells two Pepsis. After
   three years of good rains, aid workers reckon that the risk of severe
   food shortages has, for the moment, receded. But so marginal are the
   reserves of food and money here that one bad season could still spell
   disaster.

   The fact is that for all the aid money and Chinese loans coming in,
   Ethiopia's economy is neither growing fast enough nor producing enough
   jobs. The number of jobs created by flowers is insignificant beside an
   increase in population of about 2m a year, one of the fastest rates in
   Africa. Since every mother has about seven children, it is conceivable
   that Ethiopia, with 75m-plus people today, could overtake Nigeria (now
   140m-strong) as Africa's most populous country by mid-century. Just to
   stand still, let alone make inroads into poverty, the country must
   produce hundreds of thousands of jobs a year.

   It is hard to see where they will come from. The government claims
   that the economy has been growing at an impressive 10% a year since
   2003-04, but the real figure is probably more like 5-6%, which is
   little more than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. And even that
   modestly improved rate, with a small building boom in Addis Ababa, for
   instance, has led to the overheating of the economy, with inflation
   moving up to 19% earlier this year before the government took remedial
   action.

   The reasons for this economic crawl are not hard to find. Beyond the
   government-directed state, funded substantially by foreign aid, there
   is--almost uniquely in Africa--virtually no private-sector business at
   all. The IMF estimates that in 2005-06 the share of private investment
   in the country was just 11%, nearly unchanged since Mr Zenawi took
   over in the early 1990s. That is partly a reflection of the fact that,
   despite some privatisation since the centralised Marxist days of the
   Derg, large areas of the economy remain government monopolies, closed
   off to private business.

   Jobs for the boys

   This is where Ethiopia misses out badly. Take telecoms. While the rest
   of Africa has been virtually transformed in just a few years by a
   revolution in mobile telephony, Ethiopia stumbles along with its inept
   and useless government-run services. Everywhere else, a plethora of
   South African, home-grown and European providers has leapt into the
   market to provide Africans with an extraordinary array of cheaper and
   more efficient services, now used even by the poorest of farmers, for
   instance, to check spot prices for agricultural goods in markets miles
   away. And the mobile-phone revolution has created thousands of new
   livelihoods; at times it seems as if every boy on a street corner is
   hawking a top-up card. Not in Ethiopia.

   It is the same story in financial services, where, despite the growth
   of some smaller private banks, no foreign banks are allowed.
   Micro-finance schemes have expanded exponentially, but it remains
   almost impossible to find start-up loans for small or medium
   businesses.

                                                                       AP

                                     AP

                           Patrolling in Somalia

   There is no official unemployment rate, but youth unemployment, some
   experts reckon, may be as high as 70%. All those graduates coming out
   of state-run universities will find it very hard to get jobs. The mood
   of the young is often restless and despairing; many dream of moving
   abroad. It was this mood of resentment that the opposition tapped into
   in 2005, and the capital's maybe 300,000 unemployed young men proved a
   combustible force on the streets. The ruling party, the Ethiopian
   People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), underestimated the
   degree of disillusion with its policies, and thus overreacted when the
   opposition polled much better than expected.

   Unless the private sector is allowed to create jobs, the country's
   problems will continue to mount and the gains of development may be
   squandered. Sooner rather than later, 2m more people a year will
   overwhelm a state that is trying to provide most of the jobs itself.

   The fractious tribes

   Economic failings are Ethiopia's biggest long-term challenge; but its
   worst short-term problems are political. Just as the government is
   slowing the pace of economic expansion for fear that individuals may
   accumulate wealth and independence, so it is failing to move fast
   enough from a one-party state to a modern, pluralist democracy. Again,
   the reason may be that it is afraid to.

   The difficulties stem partly from the country's ethnic make-up. Mr
   Zenawi and the ruling elite are Tigrayans, from the north, a group
   that is only about 7% of the population. The Oromos, mainly in the
   centre and south, comprise 40% of the population and provide most of
   the country's food; but they feel excluded from its economic gains.
   The Amharas, comprising about 22%, are traditionally Ethiopia's
   educated ruling class, providing the leadership both of the Derg and
   of Haile Selassie's empire. The main opposition party in 2005, the
   Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD), was largely Amharic; they
   resent the ascendancy of the Tigrayans. And in the south-east Ogaden
   region are Muslim Somalis, who have more in common with neighbouring
   Somalia than with the remote Tigrayans.

   At one time or another, most of these ethnic groups have pursued
   secessionist ambitions at the expense of a greater Ethiopia. The
   government, to its credit, must have thought that it had drawn much of
   the poison of ethnic competition by introducing a new federal
   constitution in 1994, with many powers devolved to the regions, and by
   accepting the independence of Eritrea in 1993.

   But recent events have reignited the threat of ethnic, and thus
   political, instability. The turmoil in Somalia has led to a
   reawakening of the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which in April
   killed 74 workers, including nine Chinese, at an oil-exploration camp;
   the week before last it claimed to have killed 250 government soldiers
   in a gun battle. Some of its leaders want to be part of a greater
   Islamist Somalia, and are probably being helped by the Islamist
   militias there. The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) also continues to be
   active; though its military activities are disavowed by most Oromos,
   many sympathise with the broad aim of getting a better deal for
   Oromia. The CUD is leading the battle across the Atlantic against Mr
   Zenawi's rule, and Eritrea has tried to stoke each uprising, supplying
   arms to the Oromo rebels and even playing host to its leaders in
   Asmara, the Eritrean capital.

   Unfortunately, despite all the talk of ethnic federalism, the
   government has chosen to crack down severely on what it sees as direct
   threats to Ethiopia's integrity. This, in turn, sparks more
   opposition. The Ethiopian army has made it increasingly difficult to
   get into the Ogaden region, virtually one-fifth of the country; even
   NGOs such as Mdecins Sans Frontires have been struggling to provide
   help there. Oromo leaders complain of continuing discrimination
   against them; one of them estimates that as many as 10,000 Oromo
   sympathisers have, over the years, been rounded up and put in prisons
   across the country. Hundreds of those were university and school
   teachers arrested for giving civic-education classes that stressed
   Oromo issues--inciting protests, claimed the government.

   Bulcha Demeksa, an MP and leader of a minority Oromo party, the Oromo
   Federalist Democratic Movement, complains that in the past three
   months thousands more Oromos, many of them his own supporters, have
   been thrown into prison. He says that the government wants to
   extinguish any independent opposition outside the government-sponsored
   official Oromo party, the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation
   (OPDO). Many Oromos claim it is impossible to get state jobs in
   Oromia, such as teaching, unless they join the OPDO; farmers complain
   that they do not get fertiliser unless they join it.

   Human Rights Watch, a New York-based lobby group, says that "while
   this government is an improvement over its predecessor [the Derg], its
   human-rights record is nonetheless extremely grim." The government has
   also become highly sensitive to criticism. The Committee to Protect
   Journalists estimates that only Zimbabwe has produced more exiled
   journalists since 2001, though Eritrea is much fiercer at curbing the
   freedom of the press.

   The Ethiopian government's efforts at political control are supported
   by a wide network of informers and secret police. Critics say it is
   exploiting the jihadist terror threat to link many legitimate
   opposition campaigners and supporters with terrorist groups and take
   them off the streets. The threats from Eritrea, where a new border war
   could erupt at any time, and the Islamists in Somalia are real. But at
   this rate, argues Mr Demeksa, "the ethnic groups are on a collision
   course."

   It does not have to come to that. Many people are working tirelessly
   to bridge the differences. But if such tensions are not eased and the
   lack of jobs and opportunities not addressed, Ethiopia's future could
   get much bumpier. In that case, its friendship in a dangerously
   volatile region would be of little use to the West.


   In a country where corruption infects almost everything, is reform
   feasible?

   THE Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, for decades a source of
   corruption and national shame, is to be abolished by Nigeria's new
   president, Umaru Yar'Adua, and replaced by five new companies. The
   president, who will head a special oil council to oversee the changes,
   says he wants the reforms completed in six months. It would be an
   astonishing achievement if it happens and works.

   The industry has been very badly run for years. On September 21st a
   federal budget report said that the corporation had somehow failed to
   remit 647 billion naira (almost $5.2 billion) expected by the treasury
   last month. Production in June fell by 750,000 barrels a day, far
   below its capacity of 3m b/d.

   As well as incompetence, civil unrest has been to blame. Violence and
   pipeline sabotage have reduced output to a drip in the oil-rich Niger
   Delta, where Port Harcourt, the main city, has been under curfew for a
   month. Shell, Chevron and several other big companies have been forced
   to close their pipelines and sabotage has hobbled already decrepit
   refineries, which operated at only about one-third of their potential
   between 1999 and 2004. The Americans reckon that Nigeria has lost some
   $16 billion in export earnings in the past two years.

   Even before the violence erupted in the Delta, the industry was a
   mess. A string of military rulers saw oil revenue as a source of
   patronage and a reward for winning office. Governments spent more time
   fixing lucrative extraction contracts than investing in refineries.
   Louis Brown Ogbeifun, a former head of an oil managers' union, says a
   refinery manager could spend only $35,000 without having to ask
   permission from the central government, whereas his counterpart on the
   extraction side could spend up to $2 million off his own bat on a
   single project. When pipelines broke or were sabotaged, managers on
   the spot would have to wait for approval from the capital before
   mending them.

   Regulation has been equally erratic. Since the corporation was founded
   in 1977, its regulating arm, which was recently hived off into a new
   and supposedly independent body called the Department of Petroleum
   Resources, went in and out of company control. The new regulatory
   outfit is weak. Its cash-strapped employees still depend for various
   services, such as transport, on the oil companies they are supposed to
   monitor. The department keeps notoriously poor records. Humphrey
   Asobie, head of the Nigerian branch of Transparency International, a
   Berlin-based anti-corruption lobby, says that pay is far too low to
   stop graft.

   In a country in which oil brings in 76% of government revenues, small
   cracks cause big leaks. Audits by the Nigerian Extractive Industries
   Transparency Initiative, a body set up by the previous government,
   found that the accuracy of production figures varies widely depending
   on the purpose of the report in question. No proper metering tracks
   the output of crude oil, so no one knows exactly how much Nigeria
   produces or how much is lost in transit.

   The new government, formed only two months ago, has been admirably
   quick to take action. It has awarded a contract worth $52m to fix
   damaged pipelines in the Delta region and promised to get refineries
   working again by December. Monitoring is also improving. In May,
   before the new government was formed, Nigeria's federal parliament
   passed a law requiring the outfit that runs the transparency
   initiative to audit the oil and gas sector every year, whereas
   previously it did so every five years. The new law also provides for
   companies and officials who fail to give the auditors accurate and
   timely information to be fined.

   To push all these reforms through, the government will have to carry
   out some nifty legal manoeuvres. The energy ministry announced its
   plans before Parliament could repeal the 1977 act that created the old
   oil corporation. If the president's six-month deadline is to be met,
   Parliament will have to rush through a law to create a new national
   oil company. An energy ministry official says that all 117 laws on gas
   and oil on the statute books will have to be reassessed.

   But President Yar'Adua must take care not to cut any legal corners.
   Earlier this year, his predecessor, Olusegun Obasanjo, sold off
   several refineries in the dying days of his presidency without
   disclosing how the deals were done. In protest against this and
   against a jump in the price of petrol, there was a general strike for
   a few days in July; the new president was obliged to revoke the
   contracts. He will be loth to make the same mistake as his
   predecessor, so he has appointed two committees to draft the reforms
   and consider what laws should be passed first. But unless he manages
   to pacify the people of the Delta and so secure its pipelines and
   refineries, the reforms will be in vain.


   The passage of a long-awaited law offers a ray of hope for
   reconciliation

                                                                       AP

                                     AP

              Can Maliki be more than just a Shia poster boy?

   FOR nearly two years, Iraqis and outsiders trying to revive their
   country have been waiting in vain for politicians in Baghdad to agree
   to a clutch of laws that might coax Iraq's feuding sects towards a
   common vision. The Americans' military "surge" was explicitly intended
   to give the politicians a breathing-space so that, as security
   improved, they could force through some necessary measures. The surge
   has worked better than expected but the politicians, despite cajoling
   from their American mentors, have seemed unable to compromise. Now,
   however, the belated passage of a law to give former members of the
   once-ruling Baath party a better deal may at last unblock the
   political logjam.

   Earlier this month, parliament voted by a show of hands to approve an
   "accountability and justice" act that removes many restrictions
   imposed on the middle (but not top) level of Baath members, whose
   cadres were disproportionately Sunni. Some 30,000 one-time Baathists
   may now apply for pensions or even reinstatement in their old jobs, a
   measure meant to persuade insurgents that there is a place for the
   Sunni elite in Iraq's new political order.

   It is not yet clear whether the new law will do the trick. Radical
   Shias, who complained that its earlier drafts would have let Baathists
   infiltrate back into government and perhaps even stage a coup from
   within, were oddly supportive of the final version; it may not be
   quite as forgiving as it would first appear. Several thousand senior
   Baathists are still excluded. According to some readings of the law,
   others are barred from working in the powerful ministries of interior
   and defence. Some former Baathists complain that, whatever the law
   says, they have no desire anyway to go back to work in ministries now
   dominated by Islamist Shia parties. Others have suggested that the law
   is a ploy to lure them into the open and have them killed.

   In fact, the law's precise provisions may count less than the signal
   sent by its passage. Pensions for retired Baathists will, of course,
   be appreciated. But deBaathification affected a fairly small number of
   people; in some ways it was more a symbol than a tool of Shia
   domination.

   If the Sunni insurgency is to be tamed, it is now more vital for the
   Shia-led government to accommodate a new generation of Sunnis who have
   been strikingly successful in leading a movement known as the "Sunni
   Awakening" against those of the insurgents who are linked to the
   extremists of al-Qaeda, especially in the Euphrates river valley to
   the west and north-west of Baghdad. (The worst bloodshed is now in the
   Tigris river valley north and north-east of Baghdad.)

   The Awakening leaders want their own vigilante groups, known in
   American parlance as "concerned local citizens", to be inducted into
   the official security forces. This would give Sunni towns and
   districts the feeling of policing themselves rather than of being
   occupied by hostile Shia forces. So far, Iraq's prime minister, Nuri
   al-Maliki, has been loth to bring the Sunni vigilantes fully into the
   national security forces for fear they may later turn their arms
   against the new Shia establishment.

   Now for a little trust

   In any event, the hope is that, with the deBaathification dealt with,
   Shia and Sunni leaders may move ahead on other matters and allay some
   of the mistrust that has driven both sides into rigid positions for
   fear of losing sectarian support. Most encouraging, the Iraqi Accord
   Front, the main Sunni alliance in parliament, whose representatives
   walked out of Mr Maliki's coalition government in a huff last summer,
   says it will walk back in, restoring at least a semblance of national
   unity.

   If the government could now pass the oil bill that has been debated
   for two years, Iraqi politics really might get moving. Unfortunately,
   there is still no sign of an early breakthrough. The day after the
   deBaathification law was passed, members of parliament from the
   powerful and virulently anti-Baathist Shia movement led by a fervid
   clergyman, Muqtada al-Sadr, signed a pact with representatives of a
   secular and mainly Shia party led by Iyad Allawi, a former Baathist
   once favoured by the Americans, and with a small Sunni-led party
   called the National Dialogue Front, led by Saleh al-Mutlaq, who
   champions former Baathists' rights. The pact's signatories say that
   the federal government in Baghdad should retain full control of the
   oil industry, whereas the Kurds in their autonomous region still
   insist that they should control, among other things, the management
   and exploration of oil in their area.

   In theory, this odd-looking new alliance in parliament could count on
   up to 100 votes in the 275-member chamber. Since Mr Maliki's alliance
   with the Kurds has frayed, thanks to the row over oil and the failure
   to hold a promised referendum on the disputed province of Kirkuk, 100
   votes could be enough to bring him down. But it is not clear how
   strongly the Sadrists are wedded to the new alliance. Moreover,
   however unpopular Mr Maliki may be, few Iraqis want to restart the
   whole tortuous process of building a coalition government. Besides,
   the Sadrist movement is itself a loose alliance of local warlords and
   pliant populist politicians. Mr Sadr currently spends more time trying
   to keep his own house in order than fighting for more power at the
   national level.

   A possible shift of power in the provinces may have a bigger effect.
   The third big element in the national reconciliation package, after
   the laws to do with the Baath party and oil, is provincial elections.
   Most Sadrist and Sunni politicians refused to stand when they were
   last held, in January 2005, which meant that the provincial councils
   in Sunni areas were unrepresentative and often toothless. If militant
   groups could be persuaded to take part this time, the new councils
   might go some way to empowering the hitherto disaffected Sunnis--and
   perhaps persuade them to engage in peaceful politics. Then there might
   be more than a glimmer of hope of the country's returning to the path
   of peace.


   The surge of American troops has dramatically reduced violence. But
   Iraq's politicians may still squander an obvious chance for
   reconciliation

                                                                       AP

                                     AP


   AFTER more than three years as an interpreter for American troops in
   the city of Falluja, Dave (not his real name) recently had his hair
   cut for the first time by a local barber. Since then, several American
   marines based inside the city of some 300,000 people have also had
   their crew-cut domes locally shaved to a gleam. Six months ago they
   would have had their throats slit--and so, almost certainly, would the
   barber.

   But times have changed dramatically. Once widely considered the most
   dangerous and xenophobic city in Iraq and one of the country's most
   resilient havens of al-Qaeda, Falluja is now enjoying a new, if
   tentative, peace. So, no less strikingly, is the whole of Anbar
   province, in which Falluja lies, and most of the Euphrates river
   valley. The Americans say that if you go north and north-west through
   Hit and Haditha and up to the border with Syria near the town of Qaim,
   it is clear that al-Qaeda has been chased out--with the co-operation
   of the local Sunnis and the tribal leaders. In those areas, which
   embrace the vast majority of Iraq's Sunni Arabs outside Baghdad,
   attacks against the American-led coalition forces have dropped more
   than tenfold compared with a year ago.

   The peace in Falluja is fragile, as it is in the Sunni parts
   elsewhere. There is no knowing what would happen if the Americans left
   in a hurry. It is unclear whether al-Qaeda in Iraq (known in Western
   military circles as AQI) has been truly defeated or is biding its
   time. Nor is it certain that the local Sunni tribal leaders who have
   struck security deals with the Americans across Anbar province would,
   if the Americans left, make war or peace with the Shia-dominated
   government in Baghdad.

   But however temporary it may prove to be, it is an extraordinary
   change. In the precinct of Nazal--one of Falluja's nine, each with a
   joint American-cum-Iraqi police station--locals watch warily as a
   dozen helmeted young American marines, their guns pointed at the
   ground, tramp slowly past, avoiding puddles of sewage and piles of
   rubbish (much favoured by insurgents as a place for planting roadside
   bombs), and smiling at the knots of ragged children who shout
   "Chocola, meester" and are sometimes given pencils instead.

   After every ten steps or so, the marines swivel round and walk
   backwards, giving themselves a maximum field of vision. A couple of
   local Iraqi volunteers, clad in blue jeans and without helmets,
   accompany the patrol. Locals politely exchange salaams; veiled women
   with babes in arms retreat hastily behind high metal doors. But the
   marines say the mood has been transformed. No marine has been killed
   in Falluja since the summer's surge. The patrol stops from time to
   time as its leader, a fresh-faced corporal from Chicago, engages
   passers-by, via Dave, the newly coiffed interpreter from Baghdad, in
   amiably stilted badinage. A boy is asked about football. A shopkeeper
   talks about his oranges, and how business is only slowly improving.
   The Shia-led government in Baghdad, it is plainly believed, is loth to
   give much help to the Fallujans, with their reputation for Sunni
   extremism.

   After the Americans' ten-day attack on Falluja in November 2004, much
   of the city was a mess of rubble; despite a spate of building that
   started in the summer, also thanks to the surge, the marks of
   destruction are still visible everywhere. At least 1,500 Islamist
   militants, most of them members of AQI, many of them foreign, were
   said to have been killed in the siege, but until this spring the city
   remained a smouldering hub of insurgency.

   The turning point, apparently, was the al-Qaeda suicide-bombing of a
   policeman's funeral in May, when at least 27 locals were killed.
   Suddenly, it seems, the people began to react against al-Qaeda's
   excesses--the enforcement of strict dress codes, the banning of music,
   even (it is said) the cutting off of smokers' fingers--and were ready
   to endorse the local sheikhs' deals with the American army, even
   though it had pulverised their city.

   Al-Qaeda on the defensive

   Falluja is still not back to normal. A curfew remains in force. Just
   five entry points, guarded by American soldiers alongside Iraqi
   police, oversee access into the city. Each precinct is like a gated
   community. Every car must have an identity badge to be let in. Even
   so, a bombmaker occasionally gets through. "They're waiting and
   watching," says an American lieutenant.

   Moreover, the rest of Iraq, like Falluja, is still far more dangerous
   for Americans and other foreigners than it was in the first few months
   after the invasion of 2003, before the insurgency got going. The
   entire nerve-centre of the American administration, staffed by some
   10,000 people, remains walled off in Baghdad's so-called "green zone".
   Few foreign diplomats get out and about. Western journalists use a web
   of Iraqi reporters, but their movements are still restricted. Several
   of Baghdad's best-known streets remain off-limits to traffic.

   However, it is clear that the al-Qaeda part of the insurgency, which
   is manned almost entirely by Iraqis though its suicide-bombers and its
   strategists may still be foreign, has been hard hit. Although in
   November more than 20 civilians were killed on an average day, mainly
   by sectarian violence, that is far less than the toll a year ago, when
   the discovery of as many as 100 corpses at dawn was not unusual. An
   independent website, [4]icasualties.org, while admitting that Iraqi
   civilian deaths are hard to count, puts the figure of Iraqi security
   forces and civilians killed in November at around 560, compared with
   more than 3,000 last February. American military deaths since October
   are less than a third of the figure a year ago.

   All the indicators suggest that violence has subsided sharply nearly
   everywhere, not just in Anbar, but also in Baghdad. The border
   crossing to Syria near Qaim has opened after several years' closure.
   The oil pipeline from Kirkuk, which goes north into Turkey and should
   carry more than a fifth of Iraq's oil exports, has been flowing almost
   without a break for the first time in years; in 2006, it was open for
   barely 40 days. "We are close to a sustainable level of violence,"
   says the overall commander of the American-led forces, General David
   Petraeus. He means that fears of a murderous sectarian meltdown have
   receded, though he gives constant warning that things could slip back
   again.

   Meanwhile, the Shia heartlands around Karbala and Najaf have been
   quiet since a bloody bout of intra-Shia sectarian violence in Karbala
   in August. Since September, when the British left the centre of Basra,
   Iraq's second city, which is 95% Shia, violence there too has dipped
   very sharply--and the British, now encamped at an airport outside the
   city, are being fired on some ten times less than before.

   The Kurds are also at peace, despite the hiccup in October and
   November, when the Turkish army threatened to invade in force in order
   to clobber the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group of
   Turkish-Kurdish guerrillas who use a remote and rugged strip of Iraqi
   Kurdistan's borderland as a haven. The exception is the disputed city
   of Kirkuk, where ethno-sectarian violence, mainly between Kurds and
   Sunni Arabs, shows no sign of abating.

   But a bitter battle is still being fought upstream along the Tigris
   river valley and its tributaries, up to Mosul and beyond. The
   mixed-sect province of Diyala is probably today's bloodiest cockpit,
   where the Americans and their allies in the Iraqi security forces are
   fighting an array of Islamist and nationalist insurgents with al-Qaeda
   again to the fore.

   The surge is by no means the sole reason for Iraq's improved security.
   A truce was called in August by the biggest and perhaps bravest of the
   Shia militias, the Mahdi Army, better known to the American-led
   coalition by its Arabic acronym JAM (from Jaish al-Mahdi), whose
   gunmen are known as JAMsters. This in turn may have helped turn Sunnis
   against al-Qaeda; facing fewer attacks from the Shia militias, they
   had less cause to embrace a ruthless Sunni protector.

   The Sunni awakening

   But the biggest reason is probably the agreements that the Americans
   have struck in Anbar province with Sunni tribal leaders who have
   formed a group known as al-Sahwa (the Awakening). The Americans have
   armed some 65,000 Sunnis, with another 12,000 or so keen to sign up,
   in tribal battalions known in coalition-speak as "Concerned Local
   Citizens" (CLCs). These groups have also set up militias in some
   suburbs of Baghdad, mainly in the capital's west, where the Sunnis had
   hosted al-Qaeda with varying degrees of reluctance in the face of a
   sectarian onslaught. Some 12,000 Shia are also said to be poised to
   join CLC groups to co-operate with the Americans elsewhere.

   The Americans are also freeing thousands of the 25,000-odd detainees
   they hold on suspicion of being insurgents (quite separately from the
   thousands more in Iraqi government custody). In the past few months
   some 3,000 have been let out, and imams have been helping to persuade
   those about to be freed to disavow AQI.

   Yet another reason is what a senior British officer calls "a huge
   change in American behaviour" since the wily and thoughtful General
   Petraeus took up his post in January. Efforts to co-operate with local
   imams, to respect local culture, to hire more locals as interpreters
   and to increase the number of Arabic-speakers on American military and
   civilian staffs have borne fruit. It helps, too, that the American
   ambassador, Ryan Crocker, is an experienced Arabist who can also speak
   a bit of Farsi.

                                                                      AFP
                                                                      AFP

                                             Not quite ready to take over

   In Falluja, female officers are deployed to question and search women.
   American soldiers there almost never go into mosques. But befriending
   imams is now a priority. Earlier this week, one of Falluja's leading
   imams, Sheikh Nazar, who has been a critical ally against al-Qaeda,
   officiated at the opening of a revamped police station. "If we lose
   him, we lose the lot," says a marine lieutenant.

   It is plain that many of the CLC and tribal groups previously
   supported--indeed were part of--the national or "honourable"
   resistance to the occupation and have simply switched sides, seeing
   that, at any rate in the short run, the Americans could protect them
   against Shia militia depredations. But many insurgent groups apart
   from al-Qaeda are still fighting against the Americans and their
   allies. Some analysts have counted more than 75 of them. Certain
   prominent groups, such as the 1920 Revolutionary Brigades, named after
   an uprising soon after the British invented Iraq as a country, say
   they are simply waiting for the surge and the lull to end before
   erupting again. Others among these fractious bands are talking to the
   Americans, and may yet make peace.

   A golden opportunity

   What is clear, in any event, is that there is a gaping window of
   opportunity for economic, diplomatic and political progress. On the
   economic front, most development had been stymied by insecurity. Now
   projects are starting to go ahead. Electricity in Baghdad is on for up
   to 12 hours a day, against eight hours six months ago. Oil production,
   though still not at its pre-war level, has climbed from its trough of
   1.75m barrels a day in January last year to more than 2.5m b/d today.
   Shops are reopening in many parts of Baghdad, and businessmen are
   hopeful, though foreign investors have yet to return.

   On the diplomatic front there are hints of progress, too. American
   generals have cautiously noted an apparently greater readiness on the
   part of Syria to clamp down on al-Qaeda and the traffic of insurgents
   across its border. Iran, too, may be stanching the flow of weaponry to
   its Iraqi Shia militia friends. More broadly, there is a growing
   acceptance, both by Iraq's government and by the Americans, that
   political progress requires a regional framework in which Iraq's key
   neighbours--Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and Iran--can play a part. The
   United Nations is back in greater numbers, with a high-class envoy,
   Staffan de Mistura, ready to help, especially with tricky issues such
   as provincial polls and the question of Kirkuk.

   So Iraq's politicians at last have a chance to use the breathing space
   provided by the surge and by the Awakening to accommodate each other.
   Several issues are ripe for resolution. An oil law, to divide revenue
   equitably while giving regions (especially the Kurdish one) some
   freedom to grant exploration and management contracts locally, has
   been in the offing for more than a year. A revised deBaathification
   law, to bring back officials from the Saddam Hussein era into public
   service, is under scrutiny, along with a pensions law to give such
   officials a better deal.

   Perhaps most important, a provincial-elections law is under
   discussion. This could lead the way to new elections in the spring,
   enabling the newly "awakened" Sunnis of western and northern Iraq to
   empower themselves, especially in budget matters; last time round, in
   January 2005, they boycotted the elections. If they had real power in
   their provinces, they might drop their fierce opposition to
   devolution, which they have hitherto seen as a Western device to
   fragment their country.

   Alas, there has so far been no sign that the government of Nuri
   al-Maliki is poised to grab this opportunity. Indeed, as an adviser to
   General Petraeus glumly describes it, "The politics is going nowhere."
   The government still acts like a collection of competing fiefs, not a
   body that speaks with a national voice. Even among Shias, a paralysing
   factionalism has, if anything, got worse. The two principal Shia
   parties, Mr Maliki's Dawa and the better-organised Islamic Supreme
   Council of Iraq (ISCI), both fear the mass appeal of Muqtada al-Sadr,
   who has stayed out of government but often calls the shots on the
   streets.

   Worse, Mr Maliki is still failing to reach out effectively to the
   Sunnis. The main Sunni block in parliament, which had a clutch of
   ministries in the ruling coalition, continues to take no part in
   government. Relations worsened recently when a son of Adnan
   al-Dulaimi, a leader of the biggest Sunni block in parliament, was
   arrested with some 30 of his father's personal guards on suspicion of
   involvement in insurgent bombings. To cap it all, the Sunnis are
   sorely divided too--and not just over al-Qaeda. The main Sunni block
   in parliament is deeply wary of the Awakening in Anbar, which may
   displace it as the authentic voice of the Sunnis nationwide.

   Mr Maliki himself sounds particularly hostile to the notion of the
   CLCs--the mainly Sunni tribal militias--being inducted into the
   security forces or civil service as part of the price of peace. The
   new Shia establishment hates the arming of the Sunni militias because
   it thinks they may one day turn their guns against the Shias.

   The current edgy lull is due in large measure to a series of local
   deals cut between the American army (and the British army in Basra)
   and groups close to the insurgents, with the centrally run state
   thereby diminished. Indeed, it can be argued that such deals are
   eroding the state and its fragile institutions still more. But it may
   be the only way to go.

   A tendency to disagree

   The fundamental flaw in Iraqi politics persists. The new Shia order
   remains loth, after centuries of oppression, to give the Sunnis a
   decent slice of power; and the minority Sunnis seem unable to accept
   second place in a devolved state. Last week a deputy prime minister, a
   Sunni, denied that Shias outnumber Sunni Arabs.

   In his memoir of service as a British diplomat, among other places in
   Baghdad in the 1960s, Sir Donald Hawley characterises the Iraqis thus:

     [They] are a very talented, intellectual people and have no lack of
     experts on many subjects. They have a tendency, however, not to
     agree with one another and are no strangers to violence. Late at
     night after several strong whiskies, they could be very frank on
     many subjects, including themselves, and would sometimes grow quite
     maudlin. We are a very bad people and very difficult to govern. Did
     we not kill Ali [the Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law, whom the Shias
     revere]? Did we not kill Hussain [his son]? Very few have
     successfully dominated us...Nuri Said [the pro-British prime
     minister, assassinated in 1958] too knew how to govern Iraq," they
     would say. It is an Iraqi trait to admire strength and to respect
     it for the stability it can give.

   Mr Maliki has a last chance to change things for the better. Iraq's
   battered people are yearning for their politicians to make up. But
   some things do not change.


   The people are watching the new president to see which way he will go


   DESPITE the stench of April's elections, described by many observers
   as the most fraudulent they had ever witnessed, the new president,
   Umaru Yar'Adua, has been enjoying a honeymoon with the Nigerian
   electorate. For a country that has known little but corrupt military
   or civilian rule in the past 40 years or more, Mr Yar'Adua at least
   looks and sounds different. But now Nigerians are waiting for him to
   take the harder decisions that alone may sort out some of their
   country's more intractable problems. Only then will they be able to
   tell if he is truly up to the job.

                                                                       AP
                                                                       AP

                                              How much time does he have?

   The "servant leader", as he styles himself, has made a fair start,
   even if it amounts so far mainly to promises and gestures. Mr Yar'Adua
   has announced several plans to boost Nigeria's economy, root out
   corruption, get the power-grid working again and stem the rising
   violence in the Niger Delta region and elsewhere. He has avoided
   meddling in a corruption scandal in the National Assembly, as his
   predecessors might have done, leaving the legislature's committees to
   sort it out. And, just as significantly, he has refused to intervene
   on behalf of former state governors from his own party who have been
   indicted by the country's anti-corruption agency. The tribunals set up
   to challenge the election results have also been allowed to operate
   freely; on October 10th, one called for fresh elections in Kogi state.

   The economy is in better shape too. It is growing at about 6% a year,
   while inflation is down to single figures, about four times less than
   the rate in 2000. Better fiscal management has meant more foreign
   currency in the banks and more foreign investment. Nigeria is now the
   32nd most corrupt nation in the world, according to a Berlin-based
   anti-corruption watchdog, Transparency International, down from the
   top spot in 2000: progress of sorts.

   Yet Nigerians know that enormous problems persist; their patience may
   soon run out. In the Niger Delta, the biggest militant group, the
   Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, declared a ceasefire
   for a few months after Mr Yar'Adua took office. But last month it
   returned to its customary kidnappings and sabotage. Moreover, the
   violence has got nastier and more indiscriminate. The kidnappers have
   begun to nab children, as well as foreign oil workers, politicians and
   ordinary Nigerians. To flush the militants out of the creeks, the new
   vice-president, Jonathan Goodluck, a local man, has begun meeting
   representatives of the various Delta groups. But peace still seems a
   long way off.

   The increasing violence stretches far beyond the Delta. A report by
   Human Rights Watch, a New York-based lobby group, details how
   political parties armed rival gangs to rig elections and intimidate
   voters in 2003 and again this year. Many of the politicians have
   failed to cough up for those services, so the gangs have been venting
   their frustration on the streets.

   Despite being Africa's largest oil producer, Nigeria still fails to
   provide enough power for its own people. Electricity is sporadic in
   towns and almost non-existent in the countryside. A closet industry of
   private generators fills the gap at a price sometimes ten times that
   of state-generated power. The president created a National Energy
   Council last month and told it to come up with a plan to solve the
   power crisis in six months. But he himself seems to have few firm
   ideas how to do it.

   One constraint on Mr Yar'Adua is that most of the revenue from
   Nigeria's oil goes to the 36 states, which are then meant to provide
   the desperate people with their local services. These local
   governments are often the most corrupt. So the president will have to
   find a way of ensuring that the huge sums of money available actually
   reach the people--for instance, in the Delta. To do that, he will have
   to free himself of the political networks and alliances that he
   inherited from previous administrations and which still ensnare the
   country. Nigerians are waiting to see which way he will move.


   Will the Kurds get their way?


   AS YOU drive through the city of Kirkuk, with its drab buildings,
   dusty and rubbish-strewn streets and general decrepitude, you wonder
   why it stirs such anguish at the heart of Iraq's national-unity
   government in Baghdad. One big answer is the huge, sprawling oilfields
   on the city's western fringe.

   But for Kirkuk's Kurds and their brethren in the autonomous Kurdish
   region to the north, it is about far more than just oil. Kirkuk is a
   symbol, they say, of everything Kurdish: their people, their land,
   their history. They say they can be reconciled with their Arab
   compatriots, both Sunni and Shia, only if Saddam Hussein's
   "Arabisation" campaign--the settlement of tens of thousands of Arabs
   in Kirkuk during his three decades in power--is reversed.

   Iraq's president, Jalal Talabani, a Kurd from Kirkuk, called the city
   "our Jerusalem". But while the status of the real Jerusalem looks set
   to remain disputed for many years, most Kurds now think that Kirkuk's
   fate will be satisfactorily sealed this year. Most Arabs still
   disagree. But the tide may be flowing the Kurds' way.

   Last week, Kurdish leaders threatened to quit the government in
   Baghdad, where they are allied to the main Shia block, unless the
   cabinet of Nuri al-Maliki stopped dragging its feet over Kirkuk. A
   deal was then struck: thousands of Arabs who had settled in Kirkuk
   would be compensated with land and money if they went back to their
   original homes, mainly in the south.

   The justice minister, Hashem al-Shibli, said that those who left would
   be paid about $15,000 and given land in their former home towns. Mr
   Shibli, who has been chairing a committee looking into the issue, said
   that Kirkuk's authorities would soon begin giving out forms to Arab
   families to assess who was eligible for resettlement, which would be
   voluntary.

   The minister then surprised everyone by resigning, citing differences
   with the government and his own political block, led by a former prime
   minister, Iyad Allawi, partly over Kirkuk. The controversial Article
   140 of Iraq's new constitution provides for several things: the return
   of Arab "settlers" and a redrawing of the boundaries of Kirkuk
   province, surrounding the city; a census; and then, by November 15th
   this year, a referendum on whether Kirkuk should join the present
   Kurdistan federal region. Kurds calculate that, once enough Arabs have
   left, the vote will go their way. One Arab member of parliament says
   that 12,600 families, which means around 90,000 people, have already
   agreed to go.

   The referendum's exact terms have yet to be drafted. Among other
   things, the Kurds want to adjust the borders of Kirkuk province to
   bring back four Kurdish-populated towns (Chamchamal, Kalar, Tuz
   Kermatu and Kifri) which Saddam had put into other provinces to shift
   Kirkuk's demographic balance against the Kurds. They also want the
   Kurdish region to include a string of mostly Kurdish towns, in a loop
   running from Sinjar, west of (mainly Arab) Mosul, through Makhmur,
   south-west of Arbil, to Mandali in the south-east near the Iranian
   border. The Kurds' geographic borders, they say, should roughly follow
   the line of the Hamrin mountains.

   Many of Kirkuk's Arabs and Turkomen fiercely object to all such ideas.
   The Turkomen say they are Kirkuk's original rulers, while most Arabs
   say Kirkuk is Iraqi and should stay so. Sunni Arab nationalists
   elsewhere in Iraq, plus followers of the populist Shia cleric, Muqtada
   al-Sadr, have denounced the plan to push Kirkuk's Arab families to
   move south. Few Arabs or Turkomen trust the city's Kurdish-dominated
   authorities to treat them fairly. Turkey's government, facing
   elections this year, rejects the Kurds' claims to Kirkuk and says it
   may have to intervene militarily if the city's Turkomen are
   threatened. The Americans say Kirkuk is an internal Iraqi issue and
   are urging the Turks to stay out.

   So there are fears that tensions may yet boil over in a city where
   Kurds, Arabs, Turkomen and Christians edgily co-exist. This week a
   massive bomb hit a police station in a mainly Kurdish district,
   killing 15 people, including children at a nearby school. Such
   attacks, presumably by Sunni insurgents, may increase, in the hope
   that the Kurds delay the referendum. But as things stand, they are
   determined to hold it.


                                                                    Panos

   Food becomes scarcer, even in Robert Mugabe's rural strongholds

   THE meeting of the 14-member Southern African Development Community
   (SADC) in Zambia last week provided scant hope for the people of
   Zimbabwe. Few details emerged from behind the closed doors, but
   Zambia's President Levy Mwanawasa, who currently chairs the regional
   body and had previously compared Zimbabwe to a sinking Titanic,
   declared that problems in the neighbouring country were "exaggerated".
   With 80% unemployment, inflation that could now be over 10,000%, and
   severe shortages of the most basic goods, many Zimbabweans may
   disagree. Over 3m of them are thought to have left the country, and
   the UN refugee agency is working on contingency plans in case the
   exodus worsens.

   Another UN agency, the World Food Programme, reckons that 4m
   Zimbabweans--about one-third of the population--will need food aid by
   the beginning of next year. The harvest of maize, the local staple
   food, was meagre this year. Rains have been poor, and the government's
   disastrous land-reform programme has turned once flourishing
   commercial farming into subsistence agriculture.

   This is plain to see in rural Mashonaland, the area around the
   capital, Harare, and the traditional heartland of President Robert
   Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF. Most of the land where tobacco and maize used
   to grow lies fallow, taken over by wild vegetation. A few hours' drive
   south of Harare, a commercial farm that used to grow maize and rear
   cattle has now been divided into 35 plots where subsistence farmers
   try to scrape a living. The irrigation system and the water pump that
   once turned the harsh terrain into fertile soil and provided drinking
   water broke down long ago. Only one of the 100 or so farm workers who
   used to work there remains. His small plot is dry, and he has to walk
   several kilometres to get water from a neighbouring farm. He reckons
   he has enough maize to feed his family until November. When his stock
   runs out, he'll be lucky to get one meal a day until the next harvest,
   in March or April.

   A school was set up on the farm, and one of the teachers now lives in
   the main house, which was looted when the white owner was evicted.
   Even light switches have been ripped from the walls, not that they
   would be of much use now. There is electricity a few hours a day only,
   usually at night. The taps ran dry a long time ago.

   The school is in a small building that used to house farm workers.
   Teachers and parents have joined forces to try to make it work.
   Benches are made up of old planks balanced on brick stacks, and
   makeshift tables have been built from scrap wood. None of the three
   tiny classrooms has any windows or doors left. School fees are 20,000
   Zimbabwean dollars a term--or 11 American cents at the black-market
   exchange rate--but some parents cannot afford even that. The teacher
   says that a third of children in the area do not go to school at all.

   Nearby, two of his pupils are staring up a tree, slingshots in hand.
   They are hunting a monkey, their only chance of eating meat. The
   youngest, wearing shorts that reveal his bony legs, says they manage
   two meals a day: tea and bread, when available, for breakfast, and
   maize porridge later in the day. His battered shoes are far too big
   and the laces are tied around his ankles to keep them from flying off.
   He lives 4km (2.5 miles) away and walks to school.

   In another part of Mashonaland, a white commercial farmer tries to
   hang on, having lost the bulk of his farm to a senior government
   official and a few war veterans. He is one of the 350 or so commercial
   farmers thought to be left, from 4,500 before the government started
   redistributing land in 2000. A portrait of Mr Mugabe hangs on the
   office wall and he maintains good relations with local officials. The
   farmer points out that he is not fighting land redistribution itself.
   But some buildings (including his own house), valuable equipment and
   crops already planted have been taken over as well, so he is fighting
   that in court.

   He has scaled back cash crops such as wheat and maize massively, and
   focuses on exports of citrus and tobacco, which bring much-needed
   foreign exchange. The next crops will need to be planted soon.
   Uncertain about the farm's future, he ponders over whether to make the
   investment. From 1,200 workers, he now employs only about 500. "We are
   going one way," he says. "Down."

   The farm no longer makes money, but cheap government loans and heavily
   subsidised diesel help to keep him going. He also plants and harvests
   on neighbouring farms, which have been reallocated to black owners,
   and gets half the crop. Many new landowners find that reselling their
   subsidised diesel on the black market is far more lucrative than
   farming.

   Presidential and parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe are scheduled for
   next March. The ruling party has been accused of leaning on
   traditional chiefs to control rural voters. Road-blocks in Mashonaland
   are frequent. In Chegutu, close to Mr Mugabe's home, shops are
   depressingly bare, and the struggling local factories and farms have
   laid off workers. But after years of intimidation, the opposition has
   almost disappeared. There is little visible security presence. Not so
   in Marondera, 45 minutes south-east of Harare, where the much-feared
   youth militia roam the streets and the atmosphere is tense.

   Voter registration has just finished. The Zimbabwe Election Support
   Network, a local NGO, reports serious irregularities, with rural
   voters loyal to ZANU-PF registering in cities, presumably to dilute
   support for the opposition, strongest in urban areas. But Zimbabweans
   will no doubt be cheered to know that the SADC's leaders, at the end
   of their Lusaka summit, wished elections next year to be free and
   fair.


   Political upheaval in the ruling ANC

                                                                      AFP

   AFTER months of acrimony, the African National Congress (ANC) has
   elected Jacob Zuma to be its new leader. In a ballot of almost 4,000
   delegates at the national conference of South Africa's ruling party in
   the small town of Polokwane, Mr Zuma defeated the incumbent, Thabo
   Mbeki, by a wider margin than some had predicted; 2,329 votes to
   1,505. Once the result was announced, prompting mad cheers from Mr
   Zuma's followers, Mr Mbeki, visibly shaken, came on the podium with
   his rival. They embraced, to great applause, and Mr Mbeki retreated
   while Mr Zuma took his presidential seat. Mr Zuma, formerly the
   party's deputy leader, is now in prime position (though not certain)
   to succeed Mr Mbeki as the country's next president. Mr Mbeki, who has
   served two terms, has to step down as head of state in 2009.

   For a party renowned for its iron discipline, the scenes in the tents
   at Polokwane were unprecedented. Mosiuoa Lekota, the ANC's chairman
   and a supporter of Mr Mbeki, was booed and heckled from a boisterous
   floor. True to his style, Mr Mbeki delivered a dreary, technocratic
   speech that lasted for over two hours, listing the socio-economic
   achievements of the past decade. He ended by lamenting the increasing
   patronage, corruption and unprincipled politicking within the party--a
   thinly veiled swipe at his rival--and called for moral regeneration.
   But Mr Zuma's supporters broke out in songs supporting their hero as
   soon as Mr Mbeki had finished his address. They insisted on a manual
   counting of the votes, for fear that the Mbeki camp would rig the
   result.

   Mr Mbeki tried to rebut accusations that he does not tolerate dissent
   and has centralised power. But he failed to convince the party's rank
   and file, who strongly favour the more congenial Mr Zuma. For the
   first time in decades, the party's local branches were genuinely able
   to choose their leader; in the past he would have been selected by the
   party's top brass. A delegate from the Eastern Cape, Mr Mbeki's
   homeland, argued that change was needed. She complained that public
   services were still dismal in the rural part of the province where she
   lives. Another delegate, from the Free State, argued that Mr
   Mbeki--who has been at the helm of the party for almost a decade--had
   been in charge for too long already.

   Yet despite this victory, Mr Zuma is by no means assured of the
   national presidency in 2009. For a start, his past could return to
   haunt him. He was acquitted of rape last year, but the National
   Prosecuting Authority, after years of investigation, could well charge
   him for corruption again. His supporters dismiss his legal problems as
   a political conspiracy, but Mr Zuma would have to resign if convicted.
   In that case, Kgalema Motlanthe, the party's secretary-general, who
   has been elected as the party's number two, could take over.

   Whatever happens, the relationship between the government, dominated
   by Mr Mbeki's faithful, and an ANC led by Mr Zuma will be awkward. The
   next few months could see either a patching-up of the rift over the
   succession or a purge inside the party of Mbeki loyalists. There are
   even questions over whether Mr Mbeki will finish his full term as the
   country's president, although Mr Zuma has said that he sees no reason
   for his early departure.


   Robert Mugabe may be facing his most dangerous opponent yet

   THE new year has brought little joy to most Zimbabweans, as they
   struggle to survive worsening food shortages, hyperinflation and
   joblessness. But at least there is a flicker of movement on the
   political front. The ruling ZANU-PF is said to be on the brink of
   splitting, ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections due in
   March. Simba Makoni, a former finance minister, has been named as a
   prospective splinter's possible leader. Could he pose a serious
   challenge to President Robert Mugabe's hitherto firm grip on power?

   Mr Makoni, who has been in and out of cabinet since 1980, is still
   part of the ruling party's top leadership. Widely respected as a
   technocrat and one of ZANU-PF's few stalwarts untainted by corruption,
   he is a danger to Mr Mugabe because he could appeal both to
   disgruntled people in the ruling party as well as to the opposition.
   He does not have much grassroots support, but, in the words of Sydney
   Masamvu of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based lobby, he
   heads "a coalition of the wounded, the marginalised and the bitter"
   within ZANU-PF. Some within this coalition have links to Solomon
   Mujuru, a powerful party figure and former army chief whose wife is a
   vice-president. But it is unclear whether Mr Mujuru, who has hedged
   his bets in the past, is directly involved in Mr Makoni's brave--or
   rash--bid.

   Mr Mugabe would struggle to see off a big revolt within his ZANU-PF,
   especially if it were in cahoots with the opposition Movement for
   Democratic Change (MDC). But such an alliance would be hard to forge.
   Mr Mugabe has destroyed or co-opted his rivals for decades. The
   success of this latest rebellion would depend on whether the economic
   catastrophe and Mr Mugabe's excesses make enough ZANU-PF people stand
   up to the president and then stick together. If so, it may convince
   the MDC, which is itself split into two factions and is weak on its
   own, to close ranks and jump on a bandwagon led by Mr Makoni.

   In the meantime, talks between ZANU-PF and the two-headed MDC resumed
   this week. Following the beating-up of MDC leaders last March, South
   Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, has been trying to mediate between
   the two sides. As a goodwill gesture, the MDC agreed to a
   constitutional amendment proposed by the ruling party that upped the
   number of seats in parliament, though the new constituencies are
   likely to favour ZANU-PF, which keeps a firm grip on rural areas. In
   December, repressive security and media laws were eased a bit. In a
   breakthrough, both sides agreed in principle to a new constitution.

   But the talks have not improved things on the ground. Amnesty
   International, a human-rights group, says the government still beats
   and tortures its opponents. Local watchdogs have decried
   irregularities in voter registration ahead of the election and in
   demarking constituencies.

   The MDC also wants the new constitution, which includes a requirement
   for an independent electoral commission, enacted before the election.
   This would mean preparing for it all over again, which Mr Mugabe
   unsurprisingly refuses to do. So the opposition wants the election
   postponed, and Morgan Tsvangirai, one of the MDC's rival leaders, has
   threatened to boycott it if these conditions are not met.

   Mr Mugabe, in power since 1980, is bent on winning another term. The
   South Africans hope that, fairly soon after that, he will step down
   and hand over to an anointed successor from within ZANU-PF, perhaps
   Emerson Mnangagwa, a former security chief who has been the Mujurus'
   rival in the ruling party. The new ruler might--so the plan
   goes--reach out to one faction of the MDC and form a national unity
   government. The West might then pile in with cash and advice to give
   Zimbabwe a fresh start.

   But Mr Makoni's bid, if he makes it, would turn all such calculations
   upside down. It is unclear how Mr Mugabe would handle or squash
   him--or whether Mr Makoni would take a big chunk of ZANU-PF with him
   or form a wider coalition from outside the ruling party. The MDC
   faction led by Arthur Mutambara is said to be keen to join up with
   him.

   Mr Mugabe, for his part, is said to be terrified that a new regime
   would send him to face charges of crimes against humanity at the
   international court in The Hague. In any event, Mr Makoni has given
   Zimbabweans at least a fleeting moment of hope that real change is in
   the offing at last.


   Illicit drugs flow in from all over and then flow out to Europe


   A FAIRLY typical recent morning at Murtala Mohammed, Lagos's main
   airport, saw four traffickers carrying cocaine, heroin or marijuana
   caught, arrested and X-rayed before noon. All but one of them lived
   abroad, in Belgium, India and Spain. Stuck without money or just
   looking for more, they had agreed to swallow the stuff or slip it into
   their luggage. Since the beginning of the year, Nigeria's Drug Law
   Enforcement Agency has made 234 similar arrests at this Lagos airport.
   But this, according to the agency's director-general, Lanre Ipinmisho,
   is just grazing the surface of the country's booming drug trade.

   West Africa is the newest centre for trafficking drugs into Europe.
   European demand for cocaine and heroin is rising fast and dealers,
   faced with intense scrutiny on familiar import routes, have been
   obliged to find new ones. Cocaine from the Andes is arriving at west
   Africa's ports, airports and border crossings. Heroin from Afghanistan
   is coming in too.

   Nigeria is not the only victim of the growing trade. Guinea-Bissau, a
   small country emerging from civil war and a string of coups, has seen
   its tiny export economy overrun by illegal drugs. But as the economic
   hub of west Africa, Nigeria has, inevitably, also become its
   drug-trafficking hub. Last year 44% of the west African
   drug-traffickers arrested in Europe were Nigerian (compared with 3%
   from Guinea-Bissau). Drugs have been trickling across Nigeria's
   borders since the 1980s, but over the past few years the trickle has
   become a torrent.

   Nigeria's history of fighting the scourge is not the sort to
   discourage dealers. Its drug agency, founded in 1990, was immediately
   immersed in scandal when its own top people were themselves found to
   be involved in trafficking. At the end of October the country's
   independent commission on corrupt practices called in the agency's
   former chairman and eight other officials for questioning over money
   and drugs missing from an exhibit.

   Organised criminals have also got into the business. The country's
   anti-graft body, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, says it
   often stumbles upon drugs during money-laundering raids. The most
   powerful crime syndicates are involved, says Lamorde Ibrahim, the
   commission's director of operations in Lagos. A six-person group from
   his office and the drug-enforcement agency work incognito, unknown
   even to colleagues.

   The network of gangs and dealers means that drugs are increasingly
   available on Nigeria's streets. At the Lagos State Rehab and
   Vocational Training Centre former junkies tell stories of taking to
   drugs while at university, or jobless, or under pressure from the
   city's notorious gangs of "area boys". Enough cannabis to roll one
   cigarette can be found on the streets for as little as 20 naira (about
   15 cents). The UN's drugs office estimates that heroin and cocaine
   cost slightly more, at 20 to 50 naira and 80 to 100 naira a pinch.

   Reform of the drug agency may have begun to be serious. Pointing to a
   change, Mr Ipinmisho says that traffickers are often confused by their
   arrest, having been promised safe passage through the airport by
   junior officers, who can now no longer sneak them through. The
   intentions may be better, but the agency still complains of its lack
   of equipment and manpower.

   Nigeria is the only west African country on America's list of major
   drug-producing and transit countries. It is concerned enough to have
   sent Tom Schweich, the State Department's international drugs man, to
   Nigeria last month. He promised to supply the latest body-cavity X-ray
   machines to four of Nigeria's international airports. New technology
   like this will be installed first at the airports and then, more
   slowly, at ports and land borders. Not too slowly, Nigerians hope.
   Their country is already notorious for corruption and financial crime;
   the last thing it needs is narcotics too.


   The ruling party has purged itself of some of its tensions--for now


   WHAT a difference a few days make. When the ruling African National
   Congress (ANC) opened its policy conference outside Johannesburg last
   week, some boisterous delegates, singing and dancing, were waving
   flags of support for the party's number two, Jacob Zuma, who was
   sacked as South Africa's deputy president in 2005. A group of
   teachers, who had been on strike for nearly a month, picketed in front
   of the meeting hall. But by the time the get-together finished, ANC
   delegates were all back on-message, cheering wildly for President
   Thabo Mbeki, and the public-service strike was over.

                                                                  Reuters

                                  Reuters

         Mbeki and Zuma; smiles for the cameras, knives in the back

   This latest outbreak of amity and goodwill may not last long. In
   December the party has to choose its next leader, who will then stand
   an excellent chance of becoming the country's next president. The
   forthcoming decision has split the party. Mr Zuma's supporters are
   convinced that his sacking from the government, after his financial
   adviser was convicted for corruption, was nothing but a political move
   to block him from the top job. Since then he has been acquitted on
   charges of rape, though he may still be charged with corruption
   himself.

   The support inside the ANC for Mr Zuma reflects a wider resentment.
   Many party members feel that under Mr Mbeki too much power has been
   concentrated within the president's office and that government
   officials have sidelined the party. The ANC's allies in the Communist
   Party and the trade unions also feel left out. And they have
   criticised the government's economic policy for being too friendly to
   business.

   Some of these tensions seem to have been soothed by the intense
   discussions at the policy conference. One notable recommendation was
   to decentralise the appointment of mayors and provincial premiers,
   which has rested with the party's leaders since 1997. This should help
   pacify those who feel that the leadership has become too
   authoritarian.

   A pragmatic compromise was crafted around the succession. Mr Zuma's
   supporters came to the conference pushing for the ANC president to be
   made the party's automatic candidate for president of the country.
   This would have disqualified Mr Mbeki from continuing as party leader,
   as he is constitutionally barred from running for a third term as
   South Africa's president in 2009. But in the end the conference
   recommended only that it would be preferable to combine the two jobs,
   without changing the party rules to say so explicitly. And Mr Mbeki
   has pointedly not excluded the possibility of running for a third term
   as ANC president, especially if he feels that he has to block a
   successor on whom he is not keen--such as Mr Zuma.

   However, other candidates might yet emerge. Tokyo Sexwale, a prominent
   businessman and a former political prisoner, like Nelson Mandela, on
   Robben Island, has said that he would take the job if asked by the
   party. But he may have been out of the ANC's top echelons for too long
   to make it. Cyril Ramaphosa is another possibility. A former trade
   unionist turned businessman with an established international profile,
   he is still part of the party's top leadership and very popular. But
   he has kept very quiet lately and no one knows whether he really wants
   the job. Kgalema Motlanthe, the ANC's secretary-general, has also been
   touted as a possible compromise candidate.

   The ANC has once again demonstrated its ability to keep itself
   together. But as the party edges closer to December, when real
   decisions on policies and leaders will have to be made, the
   disagreements may well heat up again. And the stakes will be that much
   higher.


   The economy is shaking as government and opposition remain deadlocked

                                                                  Reuters
                                                                  Reuters


   NEARLY three weeks after a bitterly disputed election, President Mwai
   Kibaki (left), who almost certainly lost it, is defiantly refusing to
   compromise, let alone bow out, in the hope that time is on his side
   and that the fury of the thwarted opposition, led by Raila Odinga and
   his Orange Democratic Movement, will gradually subside. International
   mediators and Western diplomats have made no headway. The violence,
   which has caused some 600 deaths, has lessened a bit but has certainly
   not ended.

   Mr Odinga's Oranges won at least one notable victory this week after
   Parliament reopened. Despite a determined and expensive effort by the
   president's men to win over representatives from smaller parties, the
   Oranges got their choice as speaker, the third office in the land,
   when Kenneth Marende, a lawyer, squeaked in by 105 votes to 101. "I
   need all the prayers I can get," he said afterwards.

   Indeed he does. At times the proceedings were absurd. "Let us not make
   this political," implored the presiding clerk, while the two front
   benches exchanged taunts of "thief" and "murderer". Mr Kibaki was
   ignored by the opposition when he limped in; the Oranges rose in
   applause at Mr Odinga's entry. Mr Marende's election as speaker may
   have saved lives. Nationwide Orange protests were disruptive but less
   lethal than they might have been.

   So far, Western governments have yet to recognise Mr Kibaki fully. The
   biggest aid-givers, including the United States, Britain and the
   European Union, are threatening to divert their largesse from
   government coffers unless he seeks a "meaningful settlement" with the
   opposition. It is unclear whether that means the West wants Mr Kibaki
   to step down.

   The Americans were at first readier to endorse his re-election,
   because he has been their sturdy ally in their war on terror, whereas
   Mr Odinga, who won most of Kenya's Muslim votes, is warier of an
   American alliance. Now, however, the Americans seem to have come round
   to the European and British view that Mr Kibaki should, at the very
   least, offer Mr Odinga and his party a big role in government or
   perhaps even agree to run the election again, though that seems highly
   unlikely.

   Other African governments seem loth to interfere. John Kufuor, the
   Ghanaian president who also chairs the African Union, tried to mediate
   but entirely failed to shift Mr Kibaki, whose inner circle is plainly
   dismissive of international arbitration. "We won the election and do
   not see any point in anyone coming to mediate power-sharing," says
   John Michuki, a former security minister now in charge of roads.
   Another would-be mediator, the UN's former secretary-general, Kofi
   Annan, this week conveniently came down with flu and delayed his trip
   to Kenya.

   But Mr Kibaki is not yet home and dry. His loss of the speakership
   shows how hard it will be for him to govern through Parliament. He may
   try to ignore it and run the country from State House. With loyalists
   running the finance, justice and energy ministries, plus the security
   services, he may be able to do so. But it may make him even more
   unpopular outside his Kikuyu heartland and increase the lawlessness.

   Meanwhile, the economy is fast beginning to suffer. Business in
   down-town Nairobi, the capital, and in provincial towns across the
   country, has slumped. Tea-brokers in Mombasa, Kenya's second city,
   whose port serves most of east Africa, say that another month of
   instability could ruin the city's regular auction of one the country's
   main exports.

   Asian Kenyans are especially jittery. Many in the western city of
   Kisumu, Mr Odinga's provincial capital, have fled to Uganda. Some in
   Mombasa say they want to leave Kenya for good. An exodus of Asians
   would badly hurt Kenya's economy. So would the loss of shipping
   business to Dar es Salaam in neighbouring Tanzania, where a number of
   container ships have already been diverted.

   Pictures of angry men with machetes have scared off holidaymakers from
   the coast. Some hotels have closed for the season, others are nearly
   empty. Dhows and camel rides have no takers. South of Mombasa, many
   businesses belonging to Mr Kibaki's fellow Kikuyus have been burnt.

   If Mr Kibaki wants to rescue Kenya's faltering economy, let alone mend
   its politics, he must seek a compromise with his angry opponents. It
   is not yet clear whether time is on his side--or on Mr Odinga's.


   Can rule by the people be reconciled with the sovereignty of Allah?


   "TURKEY sets a fantastic example for nations around the world to see
   where it's possible to have a democracy coexist with a great religion
   like Islam." Those were George Bush's words of welcome, this week, to
   Turkey's President Abdullah Gul.

                                                                       AP

                                     AP

              In the name of God, let's throw the rascals out

   In decades past, a Turkish leader might have been received at the
   White House with cordial remarks about his country's growing
   prosperity or its contribution to NATO. But it would have been
   strange, perhaps, not to mention religion when hosting a head of state
   who had just set a precedent that was watched with fascination by
   politically active Muslims in many parts of the world. When he became
   president, Mr Gul proved that it was possible for a pious Muslim with
   a headscarved wife to be made head of state, by a perfectly democratic
   procedure, in a country where the army is an ever-vigilant guardian
   against theocracy. For those who insist (whether their arguments are
   theological, or empirical, or both) that Islam and liberal democracy
   are quite compatible, Mr Gul's election (and Mr Bush's exuberant
   reaction to it) was a badly needed nugget of hope in a year when that
   cause has seen quite a lot of setbacks.

   Among American officialdom, confidence in the prospects for democracy
   in Muslim (and in particular, Arab) lands has fluctuated under the
   Bush administration. It reached a high point, arguably, in mid-2005,
   when Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, declared in Cairo that
   the bad old days of favouring stability over democracy were over--and
   then it plunged again the following January when the Islamist Hamas
   movement swept to victory in Palestine.

   For political scientists, especially those who have studied the
   phenomenon of "Muslim Democracy" in the belief that the Turkish case
   could be a precedent for others, the recent turmoil in Pakistan and
   the assassination of Benazir Bhutto have been a great tragedy in a
   pivotal country that had the potential to develop a new concordat
   between Islam and open politics.

   Vali Nasr, a professor at America's Tufts University, terms "Muslim
   Democracy" a newish and potentially decisive force in the non-Arab
   parts of the Muslim world. In his view, the recent experience of
   Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia all points to a
   single truth: wherever they are given the chance, Muslim Democratic
   parties (which are responsive to public opinion and thrive in an open
   political contest) can prevail over harder-line and more violent
   varieties of political Islam.

   Among the parties Mr Nasr identifies as Muslim Democratic are the
   faction of the Pakistani Muslim League that held sway until the
   military takeover in 1999; the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (in power
   till last year's coup); Malaysia's ruling UMNO party; and a cluster of
   mildly Islamic parties that share power in Indonesia (see [4]article).
   Exhibit A for Muslim Democracy is Turkey's Justice and Development
   (AK) party, which won its democratic spurs after several decades of
   sparring between generals and pious politicians. As with several other
   Muslim Democratic parties, the AK's rise reflected economic growth and
   the advent of a devout but non-fanatical middle class which resents
   the older elites of bureaucrats and generals.

   But what if any is the intellectual ground for Muslim Democracy? Roman
   Catholic thinking had to tread a long path before it reconciled its
   belief in human sinfulness with popular sovereignty; Christian
   Democracy, an important force in post-1945 Europe, was the result.

   Abdal-Hakim Murad, a British Muslim scholar, argues that Muslim
   Democrats have an easier road to travel because Islam's view of human
   nature is a less pessimistic one. But several factors have helped to
   make the Muslim debate about democracy difficult and inconclusive.
   Most of the schools of Muslim thought that have emerged over the past
   century have been intensely interested in political theory, and also
   intensely concerned with precedents set at the dawn of the Muslim era.
   But the precedents are not clear: some caliphs took power by
   inheritance, others through consensus, others by force.

   Khaled Abou El Fadl, an Egyptian-born law professor, has pointed to a
   passage from the Koran which seems to endow human beings with a
   special mandate to look after their own affairs.

     When your Lord said to the angels: "I have to place a vice-regent
     on earth," they said: "Will you place one there who will create
     disorder and shed blood, while we intone Your litanies and sanctify
     Your name?" And God said: "I know what you do not know."

   That verse, Mr Fadl has argued, seems to imply that far from sitting
   back and letting God do everything, human beings must organise their
   own society.

   Another relevant text is the story of Ali, the fourth Muslim caliph,
   whose leadership was challenged by a rival. To the fury of his zealous
   supporters, Ali agreed that conflicting claims should be submitted to
   arbitration. Posterity found Ali right and his critics wrong: human
   institutions do have a place in settling issues of state.

   From Cairo to California

   For anyone who looks to Islam's foundational texts as the ultimate
   arbiter of truth, these are resonant allusions. But arguments in
   favour of Islam's compatibility with democracy are in perpetual danger
   of being drowned out by a mixture of depressing news from Muslim lands
   and zealous ideologues on both sides of a looming civilisational
   divide.

   Whether or not they condone violence, many of the most strident
   advocates of "political Islam" still take their cue from Sayyid Qutb,
   an Egyptian thinker, executed in 1966, who regarded secular democracy
   (and all other secular forms of government, including socialism) as
   blasphemy pure and simple. In places ranging from British campuses to
   the jails and torture chambers of Uzbekistan, there are zealous
   ideologues who follow the Qutbist line that all human agencies of
   power are a violation of the sovereignty of God. Neatly converging
   with the anti-democratic zeal of these malcontents is an increasingly
   respectable argument, among sceptical Western observers of Islam,
   which holds that the Muslim faith, by its very nature, cannot be other
   than theocratic. If that is true, then encouraging moderate--in the
   sense of apolitical--versions of Islam can only be a waste of time.

   In the United States, in particular, an"essentialist" mistrust of
   Islam in all its forms has been gaining ground. One recent sign of
   this mood: when Keith Ellison from Minnesota became the first Muslim
   congressman, he was challenged, during his first television interview,
   to prove that he was not "working for our enemies".

   But in America's free-ranging debates, where the spectrum of views on
   Islam is probably wider than in any Muslim land or even in Europe,
   there are also many voices on the other side. Mr Fadl makes his case
   for the compatibility of democracy and Islam from the University of
   California at Los Angeles, probably a more secure setting than his
   native Cairo.

   Meanwhile Firas Ahmad, a columnist who co-edits a glossy Muslim
   monthly from his home in Boston, maintains that a lot of Islamic
   history--as well as the dilemmas of modern times--should be
   reconsidered in the light of the robust separation between religion
   and state which (on his reading, at least), Muslims have quite
   frequently, and cheerfully, maintained. In modern America, Muslims can
   make a big contribution to debates about greed and social justice,
   while fully respecting the country's secular constitution. And his
   favourite passages in history are the bits where believers (often
   courageous Sufi mystics) spoke truth to power, not the instances when
   pliant greybeards did favours to the sultan.

   There are, in short, many interesting things to say about Islam and
   democracy. The pity is that they are mostly being said in the West,
   not in Islam's heartland.


   Are South Africa's crime-busting Scorpions about to lose their sting?

                                                                  Reuters
                                                                  Reuters

                                    The people's hero, so leave him alone


   WHILE Jacob Zuma, South Africa's former deputy president who is
   accused of corruption, appeared in court this week, the fate of those
   who sent him there was also hanging in the balance. A commission
   headed by a judge, Sisi Khampepe, was hearing submissions to decide on
   the future of the Scorpions, the crime-fighting unit of the National
   Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Created in 1999 by President Thabo Mbeki
   to fight corruption and organised crime, the Scorpions may now be
   disbanded or folded into the regular police force, to the dismay of
   South Africans who want to make their country cleaner.

   The Scorpions have some impressive scalps. They helped convict Nelson
   Mandela's former wife, Winnie, of fraud; ditto the former chief whip
   of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), Tony Yengeni. And due
   to their investigations, Schabir Shaik, a businessman who advised Mr
   Zuma, was convicted in June of corruption and fraud, leading to Mr
   Zuma's sacking as deputy president. The Scorpions have a reputation as
   fearless knights chasing well-connected crooks.

   They also have their detractors. Mr Zuma's supporters say his
   prosecution is politically motivated. The police and the National
   Intelligence Agency accuse the unit of stepping on their toes and
   lacking supervision. During Mrs Khampepe's hearings, the justice
   minister, Brigitte Mabandla, who is responsible for the Scorpions,
   questioned the continued need for an entity outside the police force.
   She also said that the relations between the elite unit and other
   law-enforcement agencies had broken down "irretrievably", an
   allegation denied by Vusi Pikoli, the NPA's boss.

   For the liberal Democratic Alliance (DA), the main opposition in
   parliament, this is pure politics. It argues that the Scorpions, with
   their conviction rate of over 90%, are a success and should be left
   alone. The unit has its prosecutors, investigators and intelligence
   operatives working under one roof, and attracts high-calibre staff.
   That would rapidly cease if the Scorpions were folded into the police,
   says the DA. It also blames the government for turf wars within
   law-enforcement agencies and failures of accountability. The
   ministerial committee meant to keep an eye on such issues failed to
   convene until last year.

   The hearings are due to conclude this week. Once the commission's
   suggestions are on his desk, Mr Mbeki must decide on the Scorpions'
   fate. With Mr Zuma's trial not expected until next year, they may not
   survive to see the conclusion of their most prominent case.


   After China and America, it is Europe's turn to woo Africa

   IT IS a coincidence, but an appropriate one nonetheless, that Europe
   should try to relaunch its relations with Africa in Lisbon. It was
   from here, in 1415, that Portuguese ships first set out to begin the
   European exploration and conquest of the dark continent; and it will
   be here on December 8th that politicians from 53 African and 27
   European countries will gather at a summit to bury the old colonial
   relationships in favour of something more modern and "equal", as the
   Europeans like to put it.

   The get-together is the idea of the Portuguese, who currently hold the
   EU presidency; they see this first EU-Africa summit since 2000 as the
   capstone of their six-month tenure. They accept that the summit
   carries a "political price": the one-man-against-the-rest EU split
   caused by the refusal of Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown, to
   attend, in protest against the presence of Zimbabwe's president,
   Robert Mugabe. But, the Portuguese say, they had little option. China,
   and others, have forced their hand.

   For the Europeans are increasingly worried that they are losing both
   trade and clout on a continent that they used to regard as their own
   backyard. Over the past five years Europe has watched with a mixture
   of shock and awe as resource-hungry China has swept across a grateful
   continent, taking oil and minerals in exchange for anything the
   Africans want, be it money now, money later, ports or roads.
   African-Chinese trade has increased five-fold over that time to more
   than $50 billion last year. Europe's long-standing links mean that it
   is still Africa's biggest trading partner, but the Chinese are
   catching up fast. As a stark example of China's new muscle, in October
   the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China paid $5.6 billion for a
   20% stake in Standard Bank of South Africa--the biggest single
   investment ever made on the continent.

   And the Chinese are not the only newcomers. India has been buying up
   oil and mineral concessions in countries such as Sudan and Nigeria.
   America has revived its interest in Africa: it wants to take 25% of
   its oil supply from there to decrease its dependence on the Middle
   East. America has also been recruiting new allies, such as Mali and
   Ethiopia, in its fight against Islamist terrorism on the continent.

   All this has left Africa's leaders in the novel position of being able
   to pick their friends rather than being dictated to by others, be they
   white development economists or the IMF. And they are enjoying every
   minute of it. As Shamsudeen Usman, Nigeria's minister of finance,
   says: "Nigeria is becoming a beautiful bride. What is happening is the
   Chinese, the Koreans, everyone is coming around, and if European
   companies do not wake up, they will see that most of the best
   businesses are taken. For us, really, whoever gives the best terms,
   the best conditions, and is willing to come and invest, those are the
   ones that we'll do business with."

   Europe, used to privileged access to African markets and politics, has
   been left floundering by the new competition. Europeans complain that
   China damages Africa by not linking its loans and investments to
   improvements in government and human rights, as the worthy Europeans
   do. But Africans are dismissive: as one official says, "Europe is
   jealous. They say we have gotten a new colonial master, but our old
   one wasn't so good."

   Getting hung up on democracy

   The Lisbon summit will thus be an explicit counterpoint to the
   China-Africa summit of November 2006, when China cemented its new
   relationship with a promise of yet more money. Now the Europeans will
   try to woo the beautiful bride and her dowry of hydrocarbons back from
   Beijing. Europe's goodies will be a mix of concessions and
   inducements.

   The main concession, a nod to the Chinese, is to be less critical of
   African regimes that are a bit light-fingered, or disdainful of
   human-rights. Joo Cravinho, the Portuguese minister responsible for
   the summit, contends that the Europeans have been "excessively
   simplistic" in insisting on European models of government for Africa.
   Instead, Europe will in future "focus on the essence of government,
   rather than the forms, [and be] less hung-up on particular forms of
   decision-making."

   Getting into the spirit, Europe overturned its own travel ban on Mr
   Mugabe, a complete stranger to decent behaviour, to allow him to
   attend the summit, even at the expense of losing the British
   government. Mr Mugabe will be lectured on his sins--and is then free
   to join in the cuddly group photographs. This is the "political price"
   that Europe feels it has to pay for warding off the Chinese. Sudan's
   president, Omar al-Bashir, will also be at the summit, but there are
   no plans to nag him about his army's brutality in Darfur.

   Of the new inducements, trade deals called Economic Partnership
   Agreements are the ones Europe thinks will help Africa most. The EU
   argues that these are good for development, offering African countries
   full access to the European market while allowing them to keep about
   20% of their own markets closed to protect fragile domestic
   industries. But some African countries, such as South Africa and
   Nigeria, argue that they are being bullied and threatened into making
   agreements before they are ready; the EU insists all must be wrapped
   up by the end of the year. The Europeans argue that the deals are
   designed to encourage regional integration in Africa. The Africans
   retort that by making separate deals with different countries they are
   doing exactly the opposite.

   Europe's new insouciance about human rights will worry many,
   especially those suffering atrocities in Zimbabwe and Darfur, while
   the inducements hardly look tempting. Europe needs to do much better
   than this if it is to win the bride.


   Why George Bush, touring the Middle East this week, is finding the
   Arabs in a gloomy mood

   IT IS not easy to be an Arab these days. If you are old, the place
   where you live is likely to have changed so much that little seems
   friendly and familiar. If you are young, years of rote learning in
   dreary state schools did not prepare you well for this new world. In
   your own country you have few rights. Travel abroad and they take you
   for a terrorist. Even your leaders don't count for much in the wider
   world. Some are big on money, others on bombast, but few are inspiring
   or visionary.

                                                                  Reuters
                                                                  Reuters

   These are gross generalisations, of course. Huge differences persist
   among 300m-odd Arabic speakers and 22 countries of the Arab League.
   With oil prices touching record highs, some Arab economies are
   booming. The gulf between a Darfuri refugee and a Porsche-driving
   financier in Dubai is as great as between any two people on earth. Yet
   to travel through the Arab world right now is to experience a peculiar
   sameness of spirit. Particularly among people under 30, who make up
   the vast majority of Arabs, the mood is one of disgruntlement and
   doubt.

   Factors that contribute to the gloom include the discombobulating
   impact of one of the world's fastest population growth rates, failing
   public-education systems and the resilience of social traditions often
   ill-suited to the urban lifestyle that is now the Arab norm. But it is
   politics above all that shapes this generation's discontent.

   In the world at large, things have not looked good for the Arabs for a
   long time. The generation that emerged after the second world war came
   to believe in the inevitability of an Arab renaissance after centuries
   of domination by Ottoman Turks and European imperialists. Within this
   scheme of Arab progress, the problem of Palestine stuck out like a
   troublesome nail. Defeat in the 1967 war with Israel shattered many
   dreams. Yet even after Israel's victory Palestine remained a
   touchstone for Arabs everywhere. Sooner or later, it was felt, justice
   would be done.

   That confidence has taken a beating of late. Few Arabs expect the
   peace initiative George Bush launched in Annapolis last November to
   achieve anything. And the schism between Hamas and Fatah has shaken
   underlying assumptions. If the Palestinians cannot unite in their own
   cause, why should other Arabs help them? And which side to support?
   For fellow Arabs, as for Palestinians themselves, the clash between a
   heart that cries "resist" and a head that counsels compromise has
   seldom been more perplexing.

   As in Palestine, so in Iraq. In 2003 America's invasion produced all
   but universal Arab outrage. From afar, Iraqi "resistance" looked both
   natural and noble. But as Iraq has grown messier, the rights and
   wrongs have grown harder for Arabs to disentangle. There are few
   heroes in a cast that includes mass killers from al-Qaeda, brutal Shia
   militias, criminal gangs, Kurdish separatists and corrupt politicians
   as well as the American occupiers.

   Elsewhere in the region, it has become harder for thoughtful Arabs to
   blame the government-inspired slaughter in the Darfur region of Sudan
   or the stalemate between Lebanon's religious sects on a nefarious
   American foreign policy. Many Arabs still see Mr Bush's "war on
   terrorism" as a crusade against Islam. But many also note that
   al-Qaeda-style jihadism has killed more Muslims, from Morocco to Saudi
   Arabia to the squalid Palestinian refugee camps of Lebanon, than
   "infidels".

   In past decades, Arabs looked to leaders for guidance. Egypt's Gamal
   Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat, Tunisia's modernising secularist, Habib
   Bourguiba, and Kings Hussein of Jordan, Hassan II of Morocco and
   Faisal of Saudi Arabia were all flawed men. Yet they, and even
   monsters such as Saddam Hussein and Hafez Assad, enjoyed some popular
   appeal as nation-builders. Most of today's leaders, by contrast, lack
   an inspirational project. Nor is any single country a natural leader
   of the Arabs. Egypt under the 26-year-long rule of Hosni Mubarak is no
   longer the champion of "Arabism". Saudi Arabia has vast oil wealth but
   a mixed record in diplomacy: its attempt last year to reconcile Fatah
   and Hamas unravelled with humiliating speed.

   It may be a good thing that the personality-based leadership of the
   1960s and 1970s has fallen out of fashion. Unfortunately, it has not
   been replaced by more institutionally-based systems of rule, let
   alone--for all the aid and speechifying of Western do-gooders--by
   democracy. Elections are more frequent and opposition parties and the
   press somewhat freer. But this is often a case of adopting the outward
   shape of reform without the substance. Regimes point to the existence
   of parliaments, while hiding the tricks used to pack them with friends
   and exclude real opposition. They can trumpet privatisation programmes
   that reduce the role of the state, while obscuring the fact that many
   of the beneficiaries are regime cronies.

   The marginally freer press makes for more colourful news-stands. But
   some opening was probably inescapable, due to the impact of
   hard-to-block new media, via satellites and the internet. Governments
   have simply switched from absolute control of information, for example
   through state television monopolies, to enacting laws that criminalise
   "spreading false information" or "disrespecting state institutions".
   The supposedly liberalising, pro-Western governments of Morocco,
   Jordan, Tunisia and Egypt have all used such means to stifle dissent.
   Syria under Hafez Assad used to hurl dissidents into prison without
   much ado. His "modernising" son Bashar has them tried first. But they
   still end up in the slammer.

   Stratagems such as these suck the vitality out of politics. Morocco is
   one of the bolder Arab reformers. Yet despite rising prosperity, a
   relatively free press and multi-party elections, Moroccans have grown
   increasingly sceptical of a political process that remains tightly, if
   elegantly, circumscribed. As a result, voter turnout has steadily
   declined over the past two decades. In Egypt, fewer than one in ten
   voters bothered to turn out for recent polls.

   Political scientists have long blamed oil wealth--and the rentier
   economy that so often goes along with it--for the survival of Arab
   authoritarianism. No taxation without representation, said America's
   revolutionaries. Arab governments have inverted this refrain: by
   appropriating national energy resources and other rents, they neatly
   absolve themselves of the need to levy heavy taxes and therefore to
   win the consent of the governed.

   The devil you know

   A less obvious source of state power is a pervasive fear of what might
   happen in its absence. In many Arab countries loyalty to the state is
   weaker than loyalty to a sub-grouping based on kinship, ethnicity,
   religion or region. This is hardly a unique problem; many successful
   democracies still struggle with it. But Muslims have, in addition, yet
   to resolve the essential question of whether laws should emanate from
   the people or from God (see [3]article).

   Such points may seem abstract but they have practical consequences. In
   most Arab countries, regimes hold power by virtue of tradition or
   through military-backed movements that claim to represent the will of
   the masses. Where top-down authority collapses, as it did in
   post-Saddam Iraq or in the Palestinian territories after Arafat, it
   has been very hard for bottom-up politics to repair the damage.

   In such circumstances, it is not surprising that people prefer the
   devil they know to the fitna (communal strife) or fawda (chaos) that
   seem all too likely to replace it. This makes Arabs suspicious not
   just of Western advocates of democracy but also of parties such as the
   Muslim Brotherhood, which advocate change in the name of Islam. It is
   instructive to note that when such movements are confronted with
   bread-and-butter issues they tend to split between pragmatists and
   ideologues, leaving supporters befuddled. Even Egypt's highly
   disciplined Muslim Brothers, for example, are riven by tensions
   between older hardliners and younger liberals.

   The bleakness of political prospects is only one aspect of the current
   Arab malaise. The rigid social structures and strong family ties that
   form part of the cohesive strength of Arab societies have negative
   consequences too. Sex out of wedlock remains taboo, yet the cost of
   lavish weddings, hefty dowry payments and the bridal requirement of a
   furnished, paid-for home have pushed the average age of marriage in
   many Arab countries into the 30s. The resulting frustration is an
   underlying cause of troubles from youth delinquency to religious
   extremism. Paternalistic social norms hold women back, even though
   their legal status is improving.

   Let them learn about the world

   Much fanfare has surrounded the release, over the past few years, of a
   series of UN-sponsored reports on human development painting a picture
   of Arab shortcomings that range from women's treatment to the feeble
   trickle of translation into Arabic of new knowledge. An oft-quoted
   statistic from the reports is that the amount of literature translated
   into Spanish in a single year exceeds the entire corpus of what has
   been translated into Arabic in 1,000 years.

   If there is a common thread in many of these failings, it is poor
   education. Studies show a strong link between levels of schooling and
   attitudes to women's rights. Harder to prove, but equally valid by
   anecdotal evidence, is a link between breadth of reading and tolerance
   of diversity. Religious texts still out-sell every other form of
   literature in most Arab countries. This may promote punctilious
   practice of the faith, but hardly equips people for a bewildering
   world of ever-increasing choice.

   Although the proportion of Arabs with university degrees is growing
   rapidly, quality lags far behind. An annual ranking of the world's top
   500 universities, compiled by Shanghai's Jiao Tong University,
   includes only one Arab institution compared with seven universities in
   tiny Israel.

   Some Arab governments are at last responding. Qatar and Saudi Arabia
   have hired well-known consulting firms to revamp public-school systems
   designed in the 1950s. Even Syria has relaxed the state monopoly of
   higher education. Private universities are flourishing everywhere,
   sometimes with generous state aid. Dubai's Sheikh Muhammad Maktoum has
   pledged $10 billion to create a foundation to advance knowledge. Saudi
   Arabia has committed some $3 billion to build what officials promise
   will be a world-class postgraduate institute that will be beyond the
   supervision of the religiously conservative education ministry, and
   where men and women will be allowed to mingle.

   Another cause for hope, just now, is the rapid growth of most Arab
   economies. For each of the past six years the Arab world has, by some
   estimates, grown faster by at least a percentage point than the world
   as a whole. Record oil prices have helped a lot. So has demography:
   birth-rates are falling after a period of high growth, increasing the
   proportion of wage earners to dependants. This has boosted consumer
   industries, as have reforms to ease investment and trade. Give me five
   more years of 7% growth, one Egyptian minister is fond of saying, and
   many of our other problems will fade. Maybe.


   Will the United States and Iran really start talking, if only about
   Iraq?


   IT SEEMS increasingly likely, after 28 years of formal silence (with
   just the occasional back-channel mutterings and whispers), that
   American and Iranian officials will sit down together, if only to talk
   about Iraq. The two sides are expected to meet, perhaps only at
   ambassadorial level to begin with, on May 28th in Baghdad. However big
   the caveats, it will be a breakthrough. Each side is keen to assert it
   has not flip-flopped. Neither side is sure where such talks might
   lead.

   In fact, the Americans have been saying for some time they would talk
   to Iran--but only about Iraq, not about the Islamic Republic's nuclear
   plans, so long as the Iranians refuse to suspend their enrichment of
   uranium. The rulers in Tehran have also occasionally expressed a
   readiness to engage in such talks. But whenever the prospect has
   loomed large they have backed off. Now, it seems, the Iranians--at
   least, some parts of its fractious establishment--are becoming keener.
   Some members of Iran's parliament have even begun collecting
   signatures to form an Iranian-American friendship committee.

   The American establishment has been fractious too. The vice-president,
   Dick Cheney, sounded as tough towards Iran as ever during a trip to
   the Gulf states last week. But the State Department, under Condoleezza
   Rice, is plainly becoming more flexible. Robert Gates, the newish
   secretary of defence, seems to have swung the Pentagon's weight behind
   Ms Rice.

   The latest diplomatic surge gained momentum earlier this month at an
   international conference on Iraq in the Egyptian resort of Sharm
   el-Sheikh. The Egyptian hosts seated Iran's foreign minister,
   Manouchehr Mottaki, opposite Ms Rice, at a dinner, in the hope that
   the pair might exchange a word or two. But the Iranian walked out in a
   huff, complaining later that the event failed to meet "Islamic
   standards", an apparent reference to a female Ukrainian violinist who
   was wearing a supposedly immodest scarlet dress. Other diplomats
   present thought he may have disliked being bounced unceremoniously
   into a high-level summit.

   But this week things moved on. Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
   said his government was "prepared and ready" to talk to America, while
   insisting that their troops should "pack their bags" and leave Iraq
   and the Gulf region forthwith.

   It will still be hard to agree, beforehand, on the agenda, even with
   nuclear issues kept off it. The Iranians would be loth to discuss an
   issue that particularly grates with the Americans: the help Iran
   apparently gives to Iraqi Shia militias who plant roadside bombs that
   kill American troops.

   And it will be hard to detach the question of Iraq completely from the
   Iranian nuclear one. Iran keeps its links with Iraq's Shia militias so
   that, if America were to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, Iran would be
   able to make things even nastier for America in Iraq. It is highly
   unlikely that America would be able to persuade Iran to break those
   links altogether.

   Iran does have pressing if lesser grievances that could be more easily
   dealt with if the two sides did meet. One concerns five Iranians in
   Iraq who the Iranian government insists are diplomats but whom the
   Americans accuse of helping to arm Iraqi militants--and therefore
   arrested, in the Kurdish capital, Arbil.

   Iran has also long wanted the Americans to acknowledge that it has its
   own legitimate security interests in the region, some of them in Iraq.
   And if Iran and America were ever to come to a "grand bargain" that
   did include the nuclear issue, Iran would also expect America to
   disavow any intention of promoting regime change in Tehran and to stop
   helping opposition groups. That prospect is far off.

   Meanwhile, the Americans are still struggling to enlist the help of
   other nearby countries to stabilise Iraq, where the war is as bloody
   as ever. At Sharm el-Sheikh, they had hoped to get firmer promises
   from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to forgive the $50
   billion or so of debt that Iraq estimates it owes; only vague noises
   were forthcoming. The Saudis say that, before they start being
   generous, the Iraqi government should try harder to accommodate Iraq's
   Sunni Arabs. And Russia first wants Iraq to recognise a Saddam-era oil
   contract.

   Yet the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting was a bit more fruitful than other
   attempts to get the outside world to help Iraq. The Saudis, for
   example, have more or less admitted that the new political order, led
   by Iraq's Shias, is there to stay. And American diplomats say they had
   a useful talk with the Syrians. As Syria seems to be edging out of its
   isolation in the region, it may--to please the Americans--be prepared
   to do more to stem the flow of people and munitions across the border
   to insurgents in Iraq.

   A new factor is that Iraq's neighbours guess that America is
   increasingly likely to leave Iraq within the next two years,
   especially if a Democratic president takes office. That prospect is
   beginning to concentrate Arab minds. Some fear that Iraq's sectarian
   mayhem could spread dangerously beyond its borders. Most of Iraq's
   nervous Arab neighbours do not want a bloody American-Iranian bust-up.

   Fears grow of an alliance between al-Qaeda and home-grown terrorists 


   IN THE rugged hills of the interior, Algeria's security services have
   been busy bombarding, encircling, flushing out and killing rebels who
   are reputed to have joined the nebulous ranks of al-Qaeda. An
   enthusiastic press reports every twist and turn of the great
   offensive. In the past three weeks alone, the alleged mastermind of a
   pair of recent suicide-bombings is said to have been slain, an
   important emir from the south has turned himself in and dozens of
   people--mostly rebels, but also a few soldiers--have been reported
   killed in army crackdowns across the north of the country.

   This is the government's latest response to a noticeable increase in
   terrorist attacks following the forging of an alliance last September
   between the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, the remnants of
   Algeria's Islamist insurgency in the 1990s, and al-Qaeda. Four months
   later the Salafist group, better known by its French acronym GSPC,
   changed its name to the al-Qaeda Organisation in the Islamic Maghreb.
   After some co-ordinated attacks on police stations and a couple of
   roadside bombs targeting foreign workers, on April 11th the group
   claimed a triple suicide-bombing in the capital that hit not only a
   police station but also the building that houses the offices of both
   the prime minister and the interior minister. Foreign fighters have
   also been picked up near the Tunisian border. In July a
   suicide-bombing struck an army barracks 40 miles (64km) south-east of
   Algiers, followed a few days later by a prolonged and spectacular
   night-time shoot-out at a military police station in Kabylia.

   April's attacks in the capital prompted a shift in government tactics.
   For several years, ministers had talked up a peace and reconciliation
   plan, brushing off terrorism as nothing more than a "residual"
   problem. But in an independence day speech last month, President
   Abdelaziz Bouteflika called for the fight against terrorism to be
   pursued "without reprieve", heralding the new, more intensive military
   campaign. The police chief, Ali Tounsi, whose house was targeted in
   April by a car bomb that failed to detonate, has likened the progress
   of the security forces to a "steamroller". The local press, often cosy
   with the security services, talks frequently of the imminent defeat of
   the former GSPC, and even of al-Qaeda's failure to implant itself in
   north Africa generally.

   This may be too optimistic. Algeria's insurgency is a shadow of what
   it was just a few years ago but it has, nonetheless, been given fresh
   heart by the al-Qaeda alliance. Some of the country's many unemployed
   and disenchanted youths may have been lured into jihadism by slick
   propaganda and a global cause.

   Despite this, the pattern of the violence so far suggests that
   Algeria's terrorism is still mostly a local affair, rooted in the
   bloody civil conflict of the 1990s. Its principal targets remain the
   army and police and its principal financing comes from local crime,
   including kidnapping. Little evidence has emerged of operational links
   between the Maghreb's terrorists and al-Qaeda's global network. Still,
   the Maghreb is close to Europe. And that makes any scent of al-Qaeda a
   distinct worry for the wider world.


   Old suspicions and new links

   RELATIONS between Iran's Shia revolutionaries and the rich,
   Sunni-dominated, American-protected Arabian monarchies of the Persian
   Gulf have never been easy. After America's invasion of Iraq in 2003,
   and Iran's election of the fire-breathing Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as
   president in 2005, they grew markedly worse. Arab fears of Iran's
   regional ambitions, its influence over Shia minorities and its nuclear
   programme have lately been matched by Iranian worries about the
   loyalty of its own Arabs and the possibility of an attack launched
   from the American bases that speckle the opposite shore.

   But recent events signal a possible change. On the same day on which a
   new American National Intelligence Estimate overturned previous
   assertions that Iran is actively pursuing nuclear weapons, President
   Ahmadinejad made a first-ever appearance as a guest at the annual
   summit of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), a body created in 1981
   largely with the goal of containing revolutionary Iran. Soon after the
   summit meeting, Saudi Arabia, the biggest by far of the GCC's six
   member states and long the most hostile to Iran, invited Mr
   Ahmadinejad to take part in the annual haj pilgrimage to Mecca.
   Another Arab heavyweight, Egypt, has also joined the charm offensive,
   sending its first high-level delegation to Iran in several years.

   Cross-Gulf suspicions, however, have not suddenly evaporated. Like
   many Western governments, the Gulf monarchies remain concerned that
   Iran's nuclear programme is oddly shaped for civilian-only purposes
   (see [3]article). Arab leaders continue to charge Iran with a host of
   misdemeanours, ranging from alleged meddling in Iraq, Lebanon and
   Palestine to occupying a trio of mid-Gulf islands claimed by the
   United Arab Emirates (UAE). Mr Ahmadinejad's proposal, at the summit,
   to pursue a regional security pact "without foreign influence" was
   viewed sceptically, as merely a way for Iran to replace America as the
   Gulf's guardian.

   Still, there is relief over the lessening of tensions. However much
   they dislike Iran's mullahs, Gulf Arabs dislike more the idea of
   getting caught up in a war between Iran and America. In recent months
   they have not been especially happy with their erstwhile American
   ally, despite the Bush administration's belated effort to address Arab
   concerns over Palestine and to disentangle itself from Iraq. Earlier
   this year, for instance, the parliament of Bahrain, an island state
   that hosts America's Fifth Fleet, passed a non-binding motion banning
   the use of its territory for any attack on Iran.

   Economic considerations are also playing their part. Cross-Gulf trade
   is growing fast. Bahrain itself recently signed a deal to import
   Iranian natural gas. And this link pales by comparison with the
   flourishing trade between Iran and Dubai, the most mercantile of the
   seven emirates that make up the UAE.

   Partly because of sanctions, and partly because of the restrictive
   business environment in Iran, tiny Dubai has become a vital lifeline
   for its vast neighbour. As many as 400,000 Iranian expatriates now
   live in the UAE, with nearly 9,000 part-Iranian-owned firms registered
   with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Iran is the main
   destination for exports from Dubai, with much of the volume hauled by
   the scores of picturesque dhows that line the city-state's Creek. The
   Iranian leadership likes to paint this relationship as one that
   benefits Gulf Arabs more than itself. But with its own inefficient
   economy foundering, and with the GCC countries jointly wielding
   hundreds of billions of dollars in investment capital, it is the Arabs
   who now carry greater clout.


   Iraq's Kurds have never had it so good. But they still have a long way
   to go before securing a safe and stable, let alone democratic, future


   DURING a recent voyage around Iraqi Kurdistan, not a single sign or
   hint that the place is officially part of a federal Iraq was in
   evidence. Landing at Erbil International Airport (as the Kurds call
   it, invariably also noting that it has one of the longest runways in
   the world), you see no shadow of an Iraqi, as opposed to Kurdish,
   presence. You show your passport or offer your bags for inspection to
   officers bearing bright Kurdish insignia on crisp uniforms.

   In the past month, virtually no insurgent violence has been recorded
   in Iraqi Kurdistan, bar a shocking but isolated spate of
   suicide-bombings that killed more than 400 members of the Yazidi sect
   in two villages near Sinjar, on the fringe of the area controlled by
   the Kurds. Otherwise, the last big attacks were in May--one in Erbil,
   the Kurds' capital, the other in a town of mixed population, Makhmour,
   on the contested western edge of the region, killing at least 30
   people.

   In the rest of Iraq, by contrast, nearly a thousand civilians and
   insurgents have been killed in the same period, along with more than
   70 American soldiers. There are no American forces in Iraqi Kurdistan,
   bar a handful guarding a small American diplomatic compound outside
   Erbil. The only sizeable foreign military presence is a South Korean
   force of around 1,200, which spends much of its time helping with
   construction and IT. In short, Iraqi Kurdistan is a haven of peace in
   a sea of turmoil.

   Travellers arriving at Erbil airport jostle with Lebanese bankers,
   Norwegian oilmen and Dubai traders sniffing for business; most now
   give bomb-ridden Baghdad, 250 miles (400km) to the south, a wide
   berth. At the eight or nine security checkpoints through which you
   pass on the road from Erbil to Sulaymaniyah, the two main cities of
   Iraq's Kurdistan Region, as international documents officially call
   it, you never spot the name of Iraq on a military or police badge.

   Arabic is used hardly at all; few Kurds under 25 understand more than
   a smattering of it. Schools are starting to teach English as much as
   Arabic as a second language. Increasingly, you are expected to call
   Erbil by its Kurdish name, Hawler (pronounced, roughly, "How-lair").
   Above all, the Iraqi flag, in a region where flags matter mightily,
   flutters nowhere. It has no place at the airport or over any official
   building, such as the Kurds' lively parliament.

   The issue of maps (above) is just as toxic and tricky. Where, indeed,
   are the borders of Iraqi Kurdistan (let alone those of the parts of
   Turkey, Iran and Syria, where another 21m-plus Kurds reside, alongside
   4.6m Iraqi ones)? The Iraqi Kurds' standard map that hangs nowadays on
   ministry walls, in restaurants and for sale in kiosks shows Iraqi
   Kurdistan stretching a lot further than the area currently under the
   Kurds' control.

   It sweeps in an arc from Sinjar and Zakho, in the north-west, near the
   border with Turkey, brushes Mosul's once largely Kurdish east side,
   then runs down the east bank of the river Tigris, taking in the whole
   of the contested province of Kirkuk (which Arab maps call Tamim), then
   runs on along the Hamrin mountains north-east of Baghdad, all the way
   down to a sliver of land east of the Iraqi capital, abutting the
   Iranian border near the town of Badreh.

   Even the most acquisitively nationalist Kurds do not take this maximal
   map seriously. For one thing, some of it is inhabited predominantly by
   Arabs--who would not be trusted in Kurdistan. But most Kurds do demand
   fat chunks of extra territory, especially but not only in Kirkuk
   province, which they were deprived of by Saddam when he Arabised
   Kurdish lands by expelling Kurds and bringing in Arab settlers from
   Iraq's south and centre.

   It is hard to say exactly where Kurdish influence or control now
   extends, though a "green line" has roughly demarcated their zone since
   the end of the first Gulf war in 1991, giving Kurds an area in which
   they could safely govern themselves. But after the American invasion
   of 2003 they extended their zone of influence, marked by their own
   checkpoints (technically manned by the Iraqi army but actually by
   Kurdish units of it), in predominantly Kurdish areas west and south of
   the green line, which has become blurred and sporadically shifts.

   The Iraqi Kurds' standard map tactfully omits to paint the Greater
   Kurdistan where their ethnic brethren predominate in neighbouring
   Turkey (14m of them), Iran (some 6m) and Syria (1m). It certainly does
   not lay claim, as dreamers of a unified Greater Kurdistan do, to a
   fantastical spur of land that would jut across south-eastern Turkey
   and northern Syria to reach the Mediterranean, plus another tongue of
   territory stretching south-eastwards to let Kurds dip their toes in
   the Persian Gulf beyond Basra. That would be going too far.

   But for every Iraqi Kurd, Article 140 of the Iraqi constitution that
   was endorsed in an Iraq-wide referendum in late 2005 is a national
   mantra repeated in almost every political conversation. That article
   provides for a further referendum, following a census and a supposedly
   voluntary exchange of populations known optimistically as
   "normalisation", to determine whether people in Kirkuk province "and
   other disputed territories" want to stay as part of the Arab-ruled
   part of Iraq or join Kurdistan or perhaps, in the case of Kirkuk, live
   in a specially administered region.

   Too many Kirkuks

   That census, due to have been completed by the end of July, has barely
   begun. Most Kurdish politicians still insist publicly that the
   December 31st deadline for holding the referendum will, as the
   constitution says, be met. In private, most admit it will not. What
   they dread most is an open-ended postponement which may, they fear,
   let Kirkuk, with some 5% of the world's oil reserves, slip out of
   their grasp.

   Nor has it been decided just what questions would be asked, nor
   whether the people's wishes would be assessed district by district or
   province-wide. Officially, the Kurds want the whole province. In fact,
   many realise it would be more sensible to take just those districts
   where they are a large majority rather than incorporate slices of
   territory full of sullen Sunni Arabs who might make Kurdistan
   unworkable. At the least, the Kurds would take back the large chunks
   of Kirkuk province that Saddam gerrymandered out of the old Kurdish
   region. But the blanket of stability covering the area of Iraqi
   Kurdistan recognised by the government in Baghdad emphatically
   excludes Kirkuk city, now sealed off from the rest of Kurdistan by a
   series of intrusive checkpoints.

   Indeed, the tinderbox city at the heart of the matter is fizzling ever
   more menacingly. Per head of population, acts of violence are now more
   frequent there than in bloody Baghdad, according to a Western diplomat
   who monitors the score. Moreover, in some nearby towns in Kirkuk
   province to the south and west of the city, such as Arab-dominated
   Hawija, al-Qaeda and Saddam loyalists have established a brooding
   presence.

                                                                  Reuters
                                                                  Reuters

                                 Talabani and Barzani, pals for the cause

   Though the Kurds' line of influence (if not control) extends into some
   two-thirds of Kirkuk province, there are plenty of blurred areas.
   Kurds control the towns of Chamchamal, Kifri and Kalar, to the east of
   Kirkuk city, and hold sway over Khaniquin, near the border with Iran.
   But other towns, such as Tuz Kurmatu, which has a strong and twitchy
   Turkoman populace, and Dubus, where Arabs predominate, resist what
   they see as the Kurds' expansion into Kirkuk province's southern half.

   The oil factor is important but not crucial: if Kurdistan stays part
   of a federal Iraq, the Arabs in non-oil-rich parts of Iraq would still
   get a fair share of oil revenues, whether or not Kirkuk is run by the
   Kurds. The Kurds have agreed that they would get 17% of Iraq's oil
   income from fields already in operation. But they are still arguing
   with the authorities in Baghdad over the management, exploration and
   contracts in unexploited or not-yet-discovered fields.

   Economically viable?

   Several oil companies, mostly mid-sized and small independent ones,
   have signed deals with the Kurdistan regional government, and a dozen
   more are in negotiation, all waiting impatiently for the government in
   Baghdad to give the green light. The Kurds say they can dish out
   export permits, though the authorities in Baghdad disagree. More to
   the point, the Kurds do not control the existing pipelines for export.
   So they want to build their own "feeder" pipelines to join the
   national one just before it reaches the Turkish border. Several
   Western firms hope to get in on this act.

   Plainly, the Kurds are seeking to be as independent in economics as a
   landlocked country can be: a huge challenge. From 1991 until 2003,
   when the Americans invaded, the Kurds depended on smuggling, minimal
   trade with neighbouring countries, foreign handouts and a share (often
   stingily and belatedly distributed) of the UN's corrupt and
   maladministered oil-for-food programme. In the past few years they
   have tried valiantly to create an economy of their own. But they are
   starting almost from scratch.

   Farming was virtually destroyed by Saddam. According to today's
   planning minister, the percentage of Kurds in agriculture has dropped
   from some 60% to around 10% in the past generation. During his Anfal
   (Spoils) campaign to suppress the rebellious Kurds in the late 1980s,
   Saddam's forces destroyed more than 4,000 villages and killed tens of
   thousands of civilians--180,000, according to the Kurds.

   There is no banking ("We have no access to money," says Osman Shwani,
   the planning minister), no insurance, no postal service and in the
   past few years the Kurds' budget has entirely lacked public scrutiny.
   Commercial law is less than rudimentary. There is a gaping lack of
   statistics. Mr Shwani freely admits he does not know the size of
   Kurdistan's GDP.

   Starting from zero

   There is virtually no tax system. In theory, income tax of between 3%
   and 10% is paid by salaried earners. "But no one has ever paid taxes,"
   says Mr Shwani. One of the biggest brakes on the economy is the vast
   proportion of people on the public payroll, which gobbles up about
   three-quarters of the budget.

   But things are starting to move in the right direction. Parliament,
   elected five times since 1992, has had vigorous debates over
   Kurdistan's own oil laws--on how, for instance, to handle contracts
   with foreign investors. But even they will depend to a degree on
   harmonisation with the oil laws still not passed by a dismally weak
   and divided central government in Baghdad.

   Another huge problem for Iraqi Kurdistan is the fact that it has been
   run, since 1991, by two rival administrations. In the provinces of
   Dohuk and Erbil, the Barzani family, which runs the Kurdistan
   Democratic Party (KDP), has called the shots for generations. To the
   east, the province of Sulaymaniyah has been run by the Patriotic Union
   of Kurdistan (PUK), run by Jalal Talabani; this, too, has become
   something of a family affair. In the late 1990s, the two outfits
   fought a vicious civil war, in which at least 3,000 people--some put
   the figure at more than 10,000--were killed.

   To a large degree, the party and the union are tribal fiefs, with
   power, money and even land distributed from the top by the ruling
   families. While Mr Talabani is currently president of federal Iraq,
   Massoud Barzani is president of Kurdistan; his nephew, Nechirvan
   Barzani, is its prime minister; Massoud's son, Masrur Barzani, heads
   the powerful intelligence service. At the end of the year, one of Mr
   Talabani's men is supposed to take over as Kurdistan's prime minister.
   No one is sure whether that will happen smoothly.

   Moreover, the notion that Iraqi Kurdistan is a haven of democracy is
   far-fetched. The two fiefs control virtually all public activity,
   including the media, hitherto with remarkably little scrutiny;
   outright opposition has invariably been squeezed out, often amid
   accusations of betraying the sacred cause of Kurdistan.
   Patronage--some call it corruption--is the norm. The Islamists, with a
   reputation for honesty, are the third force, small for now, but
   waiting in the wings. If Kurdistan is to thrive, its own politics must
   loosen up and become more open, if not a Western-style free-for-all.

   Real country, real democracy?

   Yet on both scores--democracy and unity--there has been progress. The
   two administrations are undergoing a merger. All but three ministries
   have joined up (the last to unite being the most awkward: defence,
   interior and finance). On the democracy front, parliament, which
   includes four small blocks of opposition parties with the Islamists to
   the fore, has lively debates and is making government more
   accountable. A decent constitution for the region is set to enshrine
   an array of rights, including for Christians, Yazidis (a sect of their
   own) and other minorities in Kurdistan.

   Two small but plucky opposition newspapers give an airing to the
   peccadillos of the party duopoly. And even some of the party-owned
   media outlets--for instance, Kurdsat TV, owned and run by Mr
   Talabani's modernising wife, Herro--occasionally broach topics that
   were once taboo.

   Especially compared with the rest of Iraq, Kurdistan has been making
   strides on every front. But this does not mean it will survive as a
   fledgling nation.

   The Iraqi Kurds depend, in the end, on three main things: their
   hardened fighting men, known as the Peshmergas ("those willing to
   die"), technically a "regional protection force" within Iraq; their
   neighbours, especially the Turks; and the mountains ("the Kurds' only
   friends", as their centuries-old saying goes).

   The Peshmergas are probably Iraq's best fighting forces in terms of
   discipline, morale and motivation. According to Jafar Ali Mustafa, the
   Kurds' minister of state for Peshmerga affairs (in fact, the PUK's
   defence boss), they number some 200,000; half are loyal to his union,
   half to the Barzanis' KDP. A merger is proceeding steadily, he says.

   The Kurds' relations with their neighbours are just as critical.
   Turkey, with its 14m-odd Kurds of its own (many of them well
   assimilated) in a population of 75m, has frequently issued threats to
   invade Iraqi Kurdistan and clobber its Kurds if they make a grab for
   Kirkuk, where Turkey considers itself the guarantor of the rights of
   the Turkomans, their ethnic kinsfolk from the days when the area was
   part of the Ottoman empire. It also threatens to invade if Iraq's
   Kurds do not oust or corral the 3,000-plus guerrillas of the Kurdistan
   Workers' Party (PKK), who hide in the remotest mountains of northern
   Iraq, where they plan and train for their lethal operations in
   south-eastern Turkey.

   The Iraqi Kurds consider the PKK a nuisance, but are unlikely to spill
   the blood of their ethnic brothers. They argue, instead, that the
   Turks should negotiate with them. The Iraqi Kurds' leaders may,
   however, turn a blind eye if the PKK is attacked within Iraqi Kurdish
   territory, perhaps even with the complicity of the Americans, who
   sorely need to improve their relations with Turkey, a rare and crucial
   Muslim ally of America in the Middle East. But many rank-and-file
   Kurds would be furious.

   However, the Turks and Iraqi Kurds have been getting on better, as the
   Kurdish government settles down and since Turkey's mildly Islamist
   government was re-elected in July, scoring notably well in Turkey's
   Kurdish areas. Moreover, Turkey is by far the Iraqi Kurds' biggest
   economic partner. Erbil's huge new airport, for instance, is a Turkish
   (and British) project. If Turkey and Iraqi Kurdistan could come to an
   accommodation, which looks more feasible than before, it would vastly
   boost the chances of the latter's survival. To a lesser extent, the
   same goes for the Iraqi Kurds' relations with Iran and Syria, both of
   which are wary of an independent Iraqi Kurdistan but could probably
   live with it.

                                                                      AFP
                                                                      AFP

                                Kurds must plot their next move cunningly

   Iraq's Sunni Arabs and Iraq's other Arab neighbours, mainly Sunni (as
   are most Kurds), both remain deeply hostile to the notion of an
   autonomous, let alone independent, Kurdistan. They see the Kurds as
   destroyers of an Arab nation and bent on undermining the Arabs'
   professed unity on a wider scale. They are enraged by the Kurds'
   refusal to fly the Iraqi flag, and ritually accuse them of being a
   fifth column for Israel and Zionists.

   Without fail, say Kurdish ministers, visiting Arab journalists raise
   both topics. In response, the Kurds point out that several Arab
   countries have relations with Israel. "The chauvinist Arabs always
   call us a second Israel," says Mr Jafar, the Peshmerga leader. He
   denies that Israel and the Kurds have military or intelligence
   contacts. "I wish we did," he says breezily.

   Kurdish leaders are as candid about their desire for the Americans to
   stay on in Iraq or, if they are bound to withdraw, to keep a military
   base in Iraqi Kurdistan as a guarantor of the Kurds' national safety.
   "We'd like the Americans to put their biggest base in Kurdistan," says
   Mr Jafar.

   But the Americans have so far been wary of too warmly embracing the
   Kurds, concentrating instead on trying to reconcile Sunni and Shia
   Arabs in Baghdad. "We love the Americans but they don't love us,"
   Nechirvan Barzani, the Kurds' prime minister, is said recently to have
   sighed.

   Hanging on to what you've got

   Could the Kurds be satisfied with extreme autonomy in northern Iraq?
   An informal referendum in 2005 suggested that 98% of them would like
   outright independence if they could have it. But almost every senior
   Kurd in Iraq says he would accept extreme autonomy--provided there is
   a genuine federation and that the central government in Baghdad gives
   the Kurds a good deal, especially over the management and exploration
   of oil in the north. Getting back Kirkuk means a lot too; conceivably,
   a special deal could be arranged there to leave the city with a status
   of its own.

   Is it possible to feel both Kurdish and Iraqi? A former long-serving
   minister in Iraq's Kurdish government, who is a noted historian,
   barely blinks. "Frankly, no." Then, after a pause, he adds: "If Iraq
   ever became truly democratic, maybe."

   Masrur Barzani, the 38-year-old intelligence chief and possible future
   head of the Barzani clan, recommends a "three-state solution",
   presumably meaning that Iraq, which he calls "the illusion of a
   country that doesn't really exist", should one day be divided into a
   three-way confederation. To most Iraqi Kurds, the emergence of a
   kindly, federal, Arab-run Iraq in which they could have a comfy
   existence is an absurd prospect.

   Briefly after the Ottoman Turks' empire collapsed, the Kurds seemed in
   reach of a homeland of their own--only to be betrayed by the great
   powers, Britain to the fore. Now they are enjoying a golden age of
   not-quite-independence for longer than at any time in their modern
   history. So why would they risk a reversion to a past of subjugation
   by Arabs, Turks or Persians?

   If they are sensible, the Kurds will not rush towards independence. To
   be landlocked and without permanently friendly neighbours is a pretty
   hopeless recipe for statehood. The outside powers on which the Kurds
   ultimately depend, especially Turkey and the United States, would not
   allow them to break away. The Turks could throttle them economically
   if not bash them militarily; the Americans may well turn their backs,
   reckoning that it is strategically more important to curry favour with
   Turks and Arabs.

   But if the Iraqi Kurds can bed down quietly for, say, five or ten
   years, securing their borders, making their economy work, building a
   modicum of freedom if not full-fledged democracy, and staying out of
   the trouble swirling around them in the rest of Iraq, it will be
   increasingly impossible for the rest of the world to ignore their
   patently rightful claim to self-determination. They have at least a
   chance of getting it.


   A bad week for those looking forward to the end of President Robert
   Mugabe


   EXPECTATIONS had been raised ahead of a summit of southern African
   leaders on March 29th that Robert Mugabe would finally be told,
   politely but firmly, that it was time to go. The meeting had been
   called mainly to discuss Zimbabwe's dreadful economy and the arrests
   and beating of opposition leaders. Surely the president would not get
   off this time?

   Astonishingly, Mr Mugabe got more bouquets than brickbats. The
   assembled heads of state called for sanctions to be lifted to take the
   pressure off their comrade, and declared the grubby presidential
   election of 2002 free and fair. With this sort of endorsement ringing
   in his ears, Mr Mugabe smartly returned to what he knows best:
   intimidating his opponents. He called the beating of the opposition
   leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, not only "deserved" but promised more of
   the same. To cap his perfect week, Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party
   said Mr Mugabe would be its presidential candidate in next year's
   election.

   Even by the standards of the South African Development Community's
   feeble diplomacy, it was an extraordinary performance. The SADC has
   always argued that America's and Britain's more confrontational
   approach is counter-productive, but this was taking quiet diplomacy to
   the other extreme. For those looking for a glimmer of support from
   their fellow Africans in their struggle to survive Mr Mugabe's regime,
   it was a huge disappointment.

   The only slight bother for Mr Mugabe was a decision to ask South
   Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, to mediate between the government and
   the opposition. In private, neighbouring countries are growing
   increasingly frustrated and there has been movement behind the scenes.
   Ahead of the summit, both factions of the opposition Movement for
   Democratic Change, which split in 2005, met South African officials
   and presented a joint plan to solve the crisis. At the same time,
   South Africa's deputy president, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, met her
   Zimbabwean counterpart, Joyce Mujuru, and her husband, a powerful
   ZANU-PF stalwart (and former head of the army) who is said to harbour
   ambitions to succeed Mr Mugabe. Most of those ready for a change
   within the ruling party accept that any way out of the crisis requires
   the opposition's co-operation.

   In truth, though, Mr Mbeki will probably struggle to make much headway
   with Mr Mugabe, who despises the South African president. Pressure on
   him may be stronger from inside the country. Trade unions are
   organising another stay-away this week, and the opposition, though
   weak and divided, is nonetheless showing signs of regrouping. And
   despite the apparent endorsement last week by ZANU-PF of his
   candidacy, Mr Mugabe's standing in his own party has been weakened.
   The endorsement came without much of a vote, and the party's
   constitution automatically anoints its president to run for the
   country's top job.

   Still, the SADC's official show of support for Mr Mugabe has boosted
   his chances of survival, at any rate in the short run. With Africa's
   spineless politicians choosing to let Mr Mugabe carry on mistreating
   his own people, it was left to the country's Catholic church to speak
   out on their behalf. On April 1st, in an unprecedented pastoral
   letter, it denounced Zimbabwe's "racist, corrupt and lawless"
   government, comparing it directly to the regime of white settlers that
   had gone before. "This so-called quiet diplomacy is hogwash," said the
   Archbishop of Bulawayo. "You can't persuade Mugabe to leave. He has to
   be forced out." But how?


   Indonesia has some worrying radicals but it seems to be following
   Turkey, with Islamists moderating as they get closer to power

                                                                   Magnum

   IS INDONESIA, the most populous Muslim-majority country, undergoing
   creeping Islamisation? It is not hard to assemble enough recent
   evidence to give Western Islamophobes goosebumps. In late December a
   mob attacked and burned a prayer house in West Java belonging to
   Ahmadiyah, a sect deemed heretical by some mainstream Islamic
   scholars. Earlier in the month the country's Christian leaders
   complained that Muslim radicals, helped by local officials, had
   carried out a string of attacks on churches. Ten Muslim militants were
   jailed for attacks on Christians on Sulawesi island, including the
   beheading of three schoolgirls. In late November the religious-affairs
   ministry barred a liberal Egyptian scholar, Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd (who
   calls the Koran a "cultural product"), from public speaking in
   Indonesia.

   Behind many recent incidents is a vigilante group, the Islam
   Defenders' Front (FPI), which in September assaulted bars, cafs and
   hotels in Bogor, near Jakarta, accusing them of violating Ramadan.
   Another rising radical force is the Indonesian chapter of
   Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which wants a caliphate to rule the whole Muslim
   world. Last August it gathered perhaps 90,000 supporters in a Jakarta
   stadium. Its leaders condemned democracy on the basis that sovereignty
   lies in God's hands, not the people's. A not dissimilar attack on
   pluralism was made in a hardline fatwa issued in 2005 by the
   Indonesian Ulemas Council (MUI). This same semi-official body recently
   demanded the banning of the liberal Egyptian scholar.

   In 2006 a poll found that one in ten Indonesians supported terrorist
   attacks like the 2002 Bali bombings if intended to "protect the
   faith". Jemaah Islamiah (JI), the terror group behind the Bali
   attacks, is still running several dozen pesantren (boarding schools),
   putting who knows what into impressionable teenage heads. The Bali
   bombers are due to be executed in the next few weeks, possibly
   triggering a backlash by radicals.

   This all sounds worrying. But Indonesia is a huge, varied and complex
   place, and the radicals--even though some have a semi-official
   platform--are a small and not very influential minority. Contrary
   evidence abounds: liberals as well as radicals are making inroads.
   They have won a big battle over a "pornography" law that Islamists
   proposed in 2006. It would have banned bikinis and short skirts, for
   non-Muslim women too, and prohibited the Hindu minority's traditional
   dances. But a public outcry forced lawmakers to strike out all the
   controversial bits--and it still has not passed in parliament. Two new
   anti-terrorist police squads have made much progress in arresting and
   breaking up JI's leadership. There have been no attacks on foreign
   targets for two years.

   As Indonesia democratised after the fall of the (secular) Suharto
   regime in 1998, local authorities gained autonomy and became directly
   elected. Many seized the opportunity to pass sharia-based laws,
   stoking fears of Islamisation. However, Greg Fealy, an Australian
   expert on Indonesian Islam, says these laws, though successful in
   winning votes for the local politicians pushing them, have usually had
   little practical impact. He recently revisited one such district,
   Tasikmalaya, where he found "there were more schoolgirls wearing the
   headscarf but just as much gambling, prostitution and drinking as
   before."

   The formerly separatist region of Aceh was allowed, under a peace pact
   with the rebels, to introduce strict sharia. The move was popular at
   first, says Sidney Jones of the International Crisis Group, a
   think-tank, but there was widespread revulsion when the authorities
   started publicly whipping miscreants. As a result the religious police
   were drastically reined in. Overall, Indonesians seem to prefer the
   idea of living under "God's law" to the practice of it. Indonesian
   Islam has always been distinct from the Middle Eastern kind, infusing
   influences from Hinduism and other religions. This will make it hard
   for fundamentalists to get far, says Muhammad Hikam, a political
   consultant.

   Whereas a relatively small number of fiery militants and
   fundamentalists get most attention, Mr Hikam says that liberal Islamic
   scholars have successfully broken the link between religious piety and
   political Islam. Indonesians seeking a more overt expression of their
   faith, as many do nowadays, can still believe in separation of mosque
   and state. As the 2009 presidential and parliamentary elections
   approach, secular parties have been attracting voters by creating
   Islamic--but not Islamist--wings. The in-phrase, says Mr Fealy, is
   Islam Lunak, "soft Islam". Pollsters are telling politicians that it
   helps to add a mild religious tinge to speeches about social justice
   and anti-corruption. But radical stuff, like preaching an Islamic
   state, is a turn-off.

   Indonesia's two biggest Muslim organisations are Nahdlatul Ulama
   (NU)--whose long-time leader, Abdurrahman Wahid was president of
   Indonesia in 1999-2001--and Muhammadiyah, which together claim around
   70m members. They indeed used to call for an Islamic state. Nowadays
   Masdar Farid Mas'udi, a senior NU figure, says all they mean by an
   "Islamic" state is a just and prosperous one. In some ways the two
   bodies have come to resemble Europe's mainstream Christian churches:
   "Catholic" NU stresses traditional rites and the authority of
   religious leaders, whereas "Protestant" Muhammadiyah stresses the
   primacy of scripture. As with Catholics and Protestants it is family
   tradition, rather than theology, that usually determines which group
   one belongs to. Both now accept Indonesia's secular founding creed,
   pancasila, which preaches religious tolerance (though you are supposed
   to believe in God).

   Moderate success

   Several of the country's political parties began life as the political
   wings of religious movements such as NU and Muhammidiyah. But the
   parties and their parent bodies have drifted apart, even as all have
   mellowed. In recent elections a more religiously conservative group,
   Prosperous Justice (PKS), has gained votes--but polls now show its
   support slumping. One reason is that it backed the pornography law and
   has suffered in the backlash against it.

   Another, admits Zulkieflimansyah, a senior PKS parliamentarian, is
   that it has joined the (secular) coalition of President Susilo Bambang
   Yudhoyono. Its popularity has suffered because of tough policies such
   as cutting fuel subsidies. Mr Zulkieflimansyah sees his party as
   undergoing a desirable process of moderation as it "encounters
   reality". PKS--like longer-established Muslim parties before it--is
   now having to ditch the fire and brimstone to transcend minority
   appeal. Rising younger figures in the party, like him, are more
   comfortable with this than its older generation, who studied in the
   Middle East. In general, the country's larger Muslim parties are
   echoing Turkey's ruling AK party--ditching Islamism while still
   appealing to the pious. Smaller ones still holding to a hard line may
   fare badly in 2009: Mr Fealy reckons that in 200 regional elections in
   the past two-and-a-half years not a single "sectarian" Muslim
   candidate has won.

   Indonesia is, overall, edging away from radical Islamism. But the
   trend is not irreversible, and the authorities must avoid fostering
   fundamentalists by pandering to them. The MUI (the council of mullahs)
   and the FPI (the vigilantes) provide a lesson: both were created, for
   temporary reasons of expediency, by the Suharto regime but both have
   lingered to haunt its democratic successors. Mr Yudhoyono now seems to
   be trying to channel the MUI's radical enthusiasm into issuing fatwas
   against "deviant" Islamic sects like Ahmadiyah. But this only
   encourages the FPI to take up its cudgels.

   Other, more important ways to make sure Indonesia stays on the path to
   democratic pluralism are to keep the economy growing and to boost
   sluggish efforts at reforming graft-ridden public institutions. High
   unemployment provides recruits for communal violence like that in
   Sulawesi--whether or not religion is the spark that ignites the
   tinder. Poverty, combined with disgust at corrupt officialdom, push
   some people towards the Utopian promises of groups such as
   Hizb-ut-Tahrir. In Indonesia, unlike most Muslim countries, the
   ideological struggle between various forms of Islam is being fought
   largely by democratic means. The violent and the intolerant are still
   at the margins and, while the country's steady progress persists, look
   likely to stay there.


   Curbing dangerous nuclear technologies gets trickier

   WHEN Russia announced it had started shipping low-enriched uranium
   fuel to power the civilian nuclear reactor it is helping Iran build at
   Bushehr, George Bush tried to squeeze some comfort out of a piece of
   news which--for the international effort to curb Iran's nuclear
   ambitions--was a disappointing about-turn. "If the Iranians accept
   that [Russian] uranium for a civilian power plant, then there's no
   need for them to learn how to enrich," he said on December 17th.

   True, in theory. But Iran refuses to follow such logic. By making
   long-delayed fuel shipments to Bushehr now, Russia will weaken further
   the UN Security Council effort to end Iran's defiance. It also risks
   undermining plans to limit the spread of dangerous nuclear
   technologies at a time when many governments, including a number in
   the volatile Middle East, plan to invest in nuclear power.

   Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, insists Iran will not stop its
   own fuel-making: another 50,000 or more will eventually be added to
   the 3,000 centrifuge machines now spinning at its uranium-enrichment
   plant at Natanz. These, say its nuclear officials, will provide
   low-enriched uranium (used for making electricity, but at higher
   enrichment levels for bomb-making) for a separate, indigenously built
   360MW reactor at Darkhovin, in the province of Khuzistan.

   This is a puzzle. Iranian engineers are already building a 40MW
   "research" reactor at Arak that is worryingly too big for research,
   too small for electricity generation and ideally suited to produce
   plutonium (another bomb ingredient) from its spent fuel, but they lack
   skills both in reactor design and in the manufacture of the larger
   parts needed for power reactors, says Gary Samore of the New
   York-based Council on Foreign Relations. Unless Iran gets outside help
   (the Arak designs were provided by freelancing Russian scientists),
   Darkhovin could be just an excuse for Iran's continuing its own
   enrichment work.

   With Iran so obdurate, why the changed tack over Bushehr? In 2005
   Russia said no fuel would go while questions remained about Iran's
   peaceful intentions. But inspectors have plenty of those.

   Holding back on the fuel for Bushehr was one bit of Russian leverage
   in the nuclear dispute with Iran that is now being lost. Similarly, Mr
   Bush's refusal to take the option of a strike against Iran's nuclear
   facilities off the table seems a lot less credible since a recent
   National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) concluded that Iran had suspended
   some elements of a weapons programme in 2003. (Israel and some
   European governments are worried those efforts may have resumed; and
   they and American officials point out that at the very least Iran
   persists with its potentially weapons-usable enrichment work.)

   Russia's decision on fuel shipments was made before the NIE was
   published. Commercial concerns may have tipped Russia's hand, says
   Mark Fitzpatrick of the London-based International Institute for
   Strategic Studies, a think-tank. It wants to be seen as a reliable
   supplier, so as to pick up more reactor contracts from others. Russia,
   America, some Europeans, Japan and others with advanced nuclear
   fuel-related technologies also have ideas for fuel-supply services and
   spent-fuel management as an incentive for governments not to follow in
   Iran's nuclear footsteps. But Russia is helping Iran show you can have
   it all.


   Israel's government may not last long enough to strike a peace deal

                                                                       AP
                                                                       AP

                                     Can Olmert light a candle for peace?


   "SHAS is dividing Jerusalem!" At first glance, the graffito on a wall
   in the city centre looks incongruous. Shas, a religious right-wing
   party in Ehud Olmert's government coalition, vociferously opposes
   relinquishing any of what Israel considers its eternal and indivisible
   capital to a future Palestinian state. But the spray-painted slogan is
   in fact a portent of how peace talks between the Israelis and
   Palestinians, which began this week after being launched at last
   month's summit in Annapolis, may break down.

   Mr Olmert, Israel's prime minister, says he wants to conclude a peace
   agreement within a year, but the received wisdom is that his coalition
   government will fall first. The talks are unluckily timed: Israeli
   coalitions usually break up in their third year, and the five-party
   ensemble led by Mr Olmert's Kadima will have its second birthday in
   May.

   This fragility may be generic to Israeli politics. With so many
   parties jostling for space, their fortunes are volatile and many
   legislators do not get re-elected. So they are loth to destabilise the
   government in the first two years, but then switch to aggressive
   electioneering, seeking issues to make them stand out at the next
   plebiscite.

   The issue this time could be Jerusalem. Since both Israel and the
   Palestinians claim it as their capital, some partition will be
   essential for a peace agreement. This week, after an uproar over
   Israel's plans to build 300 new Jewish homes on West Bank land that it
   annexed to Jerusalem in 1980--actions that are widely regarded abroad
   as illegal--Haim Ramon, Mr Olmert's deputy, said that Israel would
   give up some other annexed neighbourhoods where Palestinians live. But
   Israeli hardliners do not want to surrender even these areas, though
   they contain neither Jews nor Jewish monuments.

   Both Shas and another coalition member, Yisrael Beiteinu, are
   right-wing but opportunistic parties that benefit from being in power.
   They might have quietly swallowed a token partition of Jerusalem
   earlier in the government's term. But in a possible election year, the
   pressure on them to block any concessions to the Palestinians will be
   intense--particularly if the right-wing Likud is the favourite to win,
   as it currently is. The graffito about Shas, plus posters similarly
   denouncing Yisrael Beiteinu which began appearing just before the
   Annapolis summit, shows that the pressure is already on.

   On top of that, Mr Olmert's government could still fall over the final
   report of a commission investigating last year's Lebanon war, or over
   any one of several corruption probes (though those threats have
   recently receded a bit). But the talks with the Palestinians are not
   necessarily doomed to failure. Mr Olmert could push them hard, hoping
   to make enough progress by the time the government does fall to
   persuade moderate voters to re-elect him to finish the job. Or Labour,
   which also supports the peace process, might beat the Likud in an
   election if its leader, Ehud Barak, were to secure general public
   approval in his current job as Mr Olmert's doughty defence minister.

   Those are big gambles, however. Another strategy for Mr Olmert, says
   Gidi Grinstein of the Reut Institute, a think-tank in Tel Aviv, would
   be to retreat from a full-fledged accord and instead try to clinch a
   deal on a provisional Palestinian state, with borders that could
   change later. The Palestinians have long opposed such an approach,
   under which they might lose more land. But if the alternative is a
   total breakdown, it may be their only choice.


   The court names its first two people suspected of atrocities in Darfur


   IN THE village of Arawala, West Darfur, the women were lined up,
   stripped naked and tied to trees with their legs apart. Throughout the
   night, the men of the janjaweed, the Sudanese government-backed Arab
   militia, repeatedly raped them. One woman said she was raped by
   between ten and 25 men. The soldiers later burnt the village to ash,
   killing many of its 7,000 inhabitants and forcing the rest to flee.

   In the town of Mukjar, also in West Darfur, a witness said she saw her
   uncle in a makeshift prison after he had been rounded up with other
   townsmen by the janjaweed and members of the Sudanese armed forces. He
   was suspended in mid-air, his arms bound to a plank in the ceiling,
   his legs tied wide apart over a burning stove. Some 60 others,
   restrained in different ways, were in the same room. All had whip
   marks on their bodies, and their clothes were bloodstained and torn.
   One had had his finger- and toenails pulled out.

   It is for atrocities such as these that Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief
   prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, has
   asked the court's pre-trial chamber to issue summonses against two
   men: Ahmad Muhammad Harun, a former junior interior minister in the
   Sudanese government and head of its Darfur security desk and now,
   astonishingly, minister for humanitarian affairs; and Ali Muhammad Ali
   Abd-al-Rahman, better known by his nom de guerre, Ali Kushayb, a
   leader of the janjaweed. Evidence against other suspects, perhaps even
   more senior, is likely to be presented later.

   More than 200,000 people are reckoned to have been killed and some
   2.5m others driven from their homes in Sudan's westernmost province
   since fighting began in February 2003, when black African tribesmen
   took up arms, complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by
   the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum. In the past month alone,
   some 46,000 more have fled from their villages in an attempt to escape
   the slaughter, rape and destruction by the janjaweed and Sudanese
   government forces.

   Making it all stick

   Mr Moreno-Ocampo's presentation on February 27th of 94 pages of
   evidence, meticulously compiled under very difficult circumstances
   over the past 20 months, provoked predictable outrage in Khartoum.
   "All the evidence the prosecutor referred to is lies," said Mohamed
   Ali al-Mardi, Sudan's justice minister. Ever since the UN Security
   Council passed a resolution in March 2005 asking the ICC to
   investigate the situation in Darfur, Omar al-Bashir, Sudan's
   president, has repeatedly sworn never to hand over any Sudanese
   citizen indicted by the court. His own government was perfectly "able
   and willing" to try the perpetrators itself. Indeed, it had set up a
   special criminal court in 2005 to do just that. As a tribunal of last
   resort, the international court had no jurisdiction.

   Mr Moreno-Ocampo always knew that admissibility would pose a problem:
   the ICC cannot prosecute people who are already being investigated or
   charged in another jurisdiction, for example in their home country.
   But after five visits to Sudan for talks with government and judicial
   officials, he is sure they are not investigating the same people (in
   regard to Mr Harun) or the same crimes (re Mr Kushayb), so his case
   against the pair should be admissible. It will now be up to the ICC's
   pre-trial chamber to decide whether he is right. It will also have to
   decide whether there are "reasonable grounds" to arraign the two.

   There are, says Mr Moreno-Ocampo. Though his investigators could not
   get into Darfur, they screened some 600 potential witnesses during 70
   missions to 17 countries, taking formal statements from about 100 of
   them. He says he has a "very strong case" demonstrating the criminal
   responsibility of Messrs Harun and Kushayb in relation to 51 counts of
   alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder,
   torture, persecution and mass rape carried out against Darfur's
   civilians in 2003 and 2004. He makes no reference to America's
   allegation of genocide.

   Mr Moreno-Ocampo's continuing investigations cover the whole period up
   to the present day. He refuses to divulge whether or when other
   suspects may be named, saying he will go wherever the evidence leads
   him. For his first case, he has targeted a chief planner and a primary
   implementer of the worst atrocities. Their testimony could prove vital
   in helping him reach those responsible higher up the chain of command.
   Human-rights lobbies are urging him to go to the top--to Mr Bashir
   himself. But this would complicate an already complex situation.

   Western diplomats are already worried about the impact of the ICC on
   efforts to get UN troops into Darfur. An agreement on a proposed
   hybrid UN-African Union force is not even close yet. Under the terms
   of the UN Security Council resolution on Darfur, Sudan is obliged to
   co-operate with the court. If it refuses, it could face sanctions or
   other measures. Meanwhile, the raping and killing in Darfur goes on.

   After a stolen election, ethnic cleansing and even the threat of civil
   war


   THE decision to return Kenya's 76-year-old incumbent president, Mwai
   Kibaki, to office was not made by the Kenyan people but by a small
   group of hardline leaders from Mr Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe. They made up
   their minds before the result was announced, perhaps even before the
   opposition candidate, Raila Odinga, had opened up a lead in early
   returns from the December 27th election. It was a civil coup.

   The planning was meticulous. All that was needed were the extra votes
   to squeak past Mr Odinga in what had been among the most closely
   contested elections Africa had ever seen. That was why returns from
   Central Province, Mr Kibaki's fiercely loyal Kikuyu heartland, were
   inexplicably held back. It was why, in some constituencies, a large
   number of voters seemed mysteriously to vote only in the presidential
   race and ignore the parliamentary ballot--despite waiting hours in the
   blazing sun. But the real damage was done in Nairobi, by simply
   crossing out the number of votes as announced in the constituency and
   scribbling in a higher number. Election monitors were turned away
   while the tallying went on. Monitors from the European Union saw tens
   of thousands of votes pinched in this way.

   Mr Odinga's supporters were not innocent either. There were
   irregularities in his home province of Nyanza. Still, it was the
   meddling in Central Province that was decisive. Officially, Mr Kibaki
   won 4.58m votes to Mr Odinga's 4.35m. A third candidate, Kalonzo
   Musyoka, won 880,000 votes. Unofficially, Mr Odinga may have won,
   albeit by a similarly narrow margin.

   The tragedy for Kenya, and what threatens to rip the nation apart, is
   that no one will know for sure. The EU's preliminary report on the
   election was scathing. Although the parliamentary election had gone
   off well, the European observers said the presidential one had fallen
   short of "international standards".

   The role of the electoral commission was particularly dodgy. On the
   afternoon of December 30th its head, Samuel Kivuitu, declared Mr
   Kibaki president. The news went out only on KBC, the state
   broadcaster. Other camera crews were led out of the building. The
   security forces sealed off the city centre against the angry poor,
   most of whom had voted for Mr Odinga. A few minutes later, in the
   twilight, Mr Kibaki was sworn in as president at the State House. In
   contrast to Mr Kibaki's first term, when the inauguration took place
   in a stadium heaving with jubilant supporters, there were no
   dignitaries or diplomats, just a few dozen loyalists and civil
   servants. Some questioned whether in fact the whole event had been
   staged earlier and pre-recorded.

   The reaction to the swearing-in was immediate. Nairobi's slums
   exploded in rage. The poor killed each other. Across the country came
   a swelling up of tribal violence, sometimes Kikuyu against Mr Odinga's
   Luo tribe, more often Luo and other tribes against Kikuyu. Hundreds
   have been killed so far and 80,000 displaced. Gang rapes and
   mutilations are widespread. Police have orders to shoot to kill. There
   has been looting in Kisumu, riots in Mombasa and pitched battles in
   Eldoret (see map). Kikuyu hiding in a church near Eldoret were burned
   alive by a mob.

   Taken together, this amounts to a pulling apart of Kenya's rich
   national fabric. Some 97% of Kikuyu voted for Mr Kibaki. Everywhere
   else he was trounced. Muslims, for instance, voted against Mr Kibaki
   by 70% or more. The Kikuyu highlands encircling the glaciers of Mount
   Kenya increasingly feel like a state within a state. The division is
   even more troubling when the parliamentary vote is taken into account.
   Mr Kibaki lost half his cabinet, including his vice-president, as well
   as a large number of seemingly unassailable members of parliament.
   This government may find it impossible to pass a budget.

   The hardliners' instincts will be to use the security services to
   reverse the freedoms of Mr Kibaki's first term--anything to avoid
   power slipping into Mr Odinga's hands. But Kenyans may not stand for
   this. The government pressured the country's mobile-phone operators to
   suspend text messages for "security reasons", without success. The
   army's strong apolitical tradition, with staff officers drawn from
   several tribes, looks to be holding.

   Mr Odinga is demanding Mr Kibaki's resignation. He is calling for a
   campaign of civil action, peaceable, but determined. On January 3rd
   thousands of opposition supporters tried to converge on the centre of
   Nairobi for a protest rally but were dispersed by the police. Later
   the same day Mr Kibaki said, for the first time, that he was willing
   to talk to the opposition "once the nation is calm".

   The expectations of the Luo and other tribes who consider themselves
   marginalised will have to be addressed, and soon. With 38m people,
   half of them under 20, Kenya's economy has to create several hundred
   thousand jobs this year just to stand still. But investment will be
   hit by the violence, as will vital tourism revenues.

   The EU had at first been reluctant to send observers, arguing that
   resources for Africa were slim and Kenya was "too stable". During the
   orderly voting, the mission did indeed look like an extravagance. A
   week later the country was teetering on the brink of civil war. A
   chastened Mr Kivuitu now says he is not sure Mr Kibaki won the
   election. The Americans and the British have been twisting arms, as
   has the African Union's head, John Kufuor. Well-connected Kikuyu
   business leaders are trying to persuade Mr Kibaki to give in and form
   a government of national unity. In the meantime, Kenya burns.


   No one, it seems, can stop Somalia's capital from imploding again

                                                                      AFP

                                    AFP


   THE surgeons in the Medina hospital in Mogadishu are used to dressing
   gunshot wounds, but they had seen nothing as intense as last week's
   fighting. Islamist insurgents exchanged small-arms and artillery fire
   with Ethiopian and government troops, killing up to 400 people, most
   of them civilians. Casualties piled up in the hospital's corridors and
   corpses rotted in the sandy streets beyond, unclaimed until a lull in
   the fighting allowed for shallow graves to be dug where people fell.

   Somalia's capital, it seems, is in danger of slipping back into a
   state of bloody anarchy. About 47,000 people have fled the city during
   the fighting and more have been queuing up to leave, by minibus,
   donkey or on foot. And all this comes only three months after the
   Ethiopian-backed government had supposedly claimed back control of the
   city from the Islamist militias that they said they had defeated in a
   swift campaign last December.

   Now the picture looks very different. Remnants of the Islamist
   fighters have regrouped. Together with disaffected fighters from the
   powerful Hawiye clan, which is used to controlling much of the
   capital, they threaten a proper insurgency.

   Furthermore, as many had predicted, the continuing presence of
   Ethiopian soldiers in the capital is exacerbating the conflict.
   Indeed, far from leaving, as they had started to do, the Ethiopians
   have called for reinforcements. Not that this is entirely their fault.
   The African Union (AU) had promised to fly in 8,000 peacekeeping
   troops to replace the Ethiopians to enforce a fragile ceasefire, but
   only 1,200 or so Ugandans have actually arrived in Mogadishu, where
   they have been restricted to protecting the airport and other
   installations. Nigeria and others have promised troops but not yet
   sent them.

   That has left the Ethiopians to do most of the fighting on behalf of
   the government, with covert assistance from America. Ethiopian
   soldiers had done a mostly impressive job of policing Mogadishu with
   little incident for three months. But they are seen as invaders by
   most Somalis and will remain unpopular, and thus targets, whatever
   they do. The same goes for the Americans. They have backed the
   government and the Ethiopians as a way of rooting out suspected
   al-Qaeda men who had operated on the fringes of the Union of Islamic
   Courts, the Somali Islamists whose brief reign had brought a modicum
   of order until they were pushed out.

   A further complication is the Eritrean backing of the ousted Islamist
   militias. Eritrea has supplied arms to them and might be doing so
   again. Yoweri Museveni, Uganda's president, visited Eritrea this week
   to ask it not to get involved, but was rebuffed. Eritrea sees the
   mayhem in Somalia as a chance to make life as hard as possible for its
   Ethiopian neighbour and mortal enemy. Eritrea says it opposes "any
   foreign involvement" in Somalia--except, of course, its own.

   The international contact group on Somalia, a body set up to try to
   resolve the Somali crisis, including representatives from America and
   the European Union, held talks in Egypt this week but produced little
   new. Somalia's government was urged again to reach out to moderate
   Islamists, but nobody knows what to do about the remaining Islamist
   fighters, who seem intent on jihad. Some diplomats in the region think
   it inevitable that, despairing of any solution, the outside world will
   just cast Somalia adrift. Many in Mogadishu think that their city
   already has been.

   What more could be done? A properly enforced arms embargo may have a
   calming effect. But the immediate challenge is to prevent Mogadishu
   sliding back into a war economy, where men with guns profit from
   instability. The signs are not good. Food prices are up by 50%.
   Extortion at gunpoint is back.

   More importantly, deals will have to be done with the Hawiye clan
   elders to try to detach them from the Islamist fighters, thus reducing
   the opposition to the government. The Union of Islamic Courts made
   themselves popular with people in Mogadishu last year by imposing
   enough order to allow people to get on with their normal business
   again. Now, for instance, the Hawiye traders complain of a threefold
   increase in duty applied to staple goods arriving at Mogadishu's port.
   Settling issues like this could make the Hawiye leaders, and the
   gunmen they control, readier to negotiate.

   If that were to happen, there may be a small chance of an
   accommodation between the Hawiye and the government. The alternative
   is dire. It took 15 years and 14 attempts to deliver Somalia the
   relative peace that the country enjoyed in the first three months of
   this year. If the country fails again, it could stay failed for a very
   long time.


   How not to run a police force

                                                                      EPA
                                                                      EPA

                                       Selebi and the pointing of fingers


   IT SEEMS, for the moment, as if South Africa's governing class is
   being engulfed by charges of corruption. Three weeks ago it was the
   turn of Jacob Zuma, the newly elected leader of the ruling African
   National Congress (ANC). He was charged with fraud, tax evasion and
   money laundering and is due in court in August. This week it was the
   turn of Jackie Selebi, the head of the police. The National
   Prosecuting Authority says it will charge him with corruption and
   "defeating the ends of justice". He has been suspended from his job
   and he also resigned as head of Interpol, the international police
   body. On January 8th the police also arrested Gerrie Nel, a senior
   member of a special investigations unit known as the Scorpions, also
   on charges of corruption. He is the man who had led the investigation
   into Mr Selebi. All the charges against Mr Nel, however, were dropped
   a week later.

   All these cases point to an unduly incestuous relationship between the
   politicians and the country's supposedly independent security
   apparatus. They also illustrate the way in which the acrimonious
   battle for power between Mr Zuma and Thabo Mbeki, the country's
   president whom he defeated in December's ANC leadership election, is
   poisoning both the civil service and the political system.

   Mr Selebi is Mr Mbeki's man, and the president has discredited himself
   by defending his friend too doggedly. Months ago Mr Selebi admitted to
   being a friend of Glen Agliotti, a drug trafficker who was implicated
   in the murder in 2005 of a shady mining magnate. When faced with angry
   public calls to replace Mr Selebi, Mr Mbeki merely asked South
   Africans to trust him. The prosecuting authority's new allegations are
   particularly damaging. It says that as well as handing out bags of
   cash to Mr Selebi, Mr Agliotti also paid for some of the police
   chief's shopping. In return, Mr Selebi protected Mr Agliotti's friends
   and shared confidential documents with him. The police chief denies
   all the charges.

   The prosecuting authority, already accused of abusing its power to
   settle scores against Mr Zuma, has itself been caught in the
   crossfire, as have the Scorpions, who report to it. In September Vusi
   Pikoli, the national prosecutor, was suspended as he was poised to
   arrest Mr Selebi. Mr Mbeki said this was due to a breakdown in Mr
   Pikoli's relations with his boss, the justice minister. But the timing
   of Mr Pikoli's fall fed suspicions that he was in fact being punished
   for going after Mr Selebi.

   Mr Nel's arrest was seen by some as retaliation by Mr Selebi's force
   against the Scorpions, since they had helped bring the charges against
   Mr Selebi. That the charges against Mr Nel were dropped so fast
   suggests that they were pretty spurious in the first place. The
   episode will only deepen the bitter rivalry between the Scorpions and
   the regular police.

   This murky sort of business would scandalise any country. But in one
   plagued by some of the highest levels of violent crime in the world,
   it is tragic that South Africa's law-enforcement officials should
   expend so much energy fighting each other rather than the criminals.
   The police judged that they needed no fewer than 20 armed officers to
   arrest Mr Nel at his home. On the hopeful side, the charges against Mr
   Selebi show that no one yet is above the law. But if they turn out to
   be true, it will further reduce confidence in a police force that is
   often perceived, at best, as merely incompetent.


   Regret and relief as British soldiers lose hope in Iraq

   THE biggest success of Britain's unhappy four-year occupation of Basra
   was its final departure from the city. Under cover of darkness, the
   500-odd men of the 4 Rifles Battlegroup rumbled out of Basra Palace in
   their armoured vehicles on September 2nd with hardly a shot fired or
   bomb detonated.

                                                                       AP
                                                                       AP

                                                    Under new management 

   The soldiers, who had been under almost daily attack, were formally
   "repositioned" to the airport a few miles away. Britain would honour
   its "obligations" in Iraq, said Gordon Brown, the prime minister. But
   after losing some 170 soldiers there, the army knows it is on its way
   out. The question is when it will leave for good.

   Mr Brown will have more to say on the subject in October. His aim will
   be to distance himself from the unpopular war in Iraq without
   undermining fatally his relationship with the Bush administration. The
   betting is that he will keep the current 5,000 troops in Iraq until
   the spring, and then draw them down to about 3,000.

   Based at the airport, the troops will maintain the headquarters and
   logistical support for allied forces in south-eastern Iraq, as well as
   providing special forces to fight alongside the Americans farther
   north. Britain is also supposed to protect southern supply routes and
   maintain "overwatch" for Iraqi forces--training and armed
   back-up--after it hands over control of Basra province later in the
   autumn. In practice, though, the British have no permanent presence on
   so-called "Route Tampa" from Kuwait to Baghdad, and prefer to stay out
   of the way of American convoys. They will do everything to avoid
   having to shoot their way back into Basra.

   Apart from defending themselves from rocket and mortar attacks at the
   airport, the main concern of the British army will be to preserve its
   public image, fending off accusations that it has failed and is
   betraying its allies by leaving. Britain says, with much wishful
   thinking, that Iraqi forces are now able to take charge of security.
   That contention seemed to hold this week as Basra went quiet.
   Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Sanders, the commander of the 4 Rifles
   Battlegroup, said that 90% of the violence in Basra had been directed
   at the British. Senior officers wonder whether the army chief, General
   Sir Richard Dannatt, was right when he said last year that the British
   had become part of the problem.

   Even if he is right, Britain seems to be at cross-purposes with
   America, which has increased its troops in Baghdad. The loudest
   American critics of Britain are the strongest advocates of the
   "surge", such as retired General Jack Keane. He claims American
   officers are frustrated by Britain's "general disengagement" from
   Basra. Pentagon officials say they accept with misgivings Britain's
   withdrawal, but worry about Mr Brown's intentions.

   They are not alone. Australian and other allied forces in southern
   Iraq fear they may be left in the lurch. Some Australian commanders
   draw comparisons with the fiasco of the British-led assault (and later
   retreat) at Gallipoli in the first world war. They are joking, but the
   British army's reputation for counter-insurgency warfare has been
   damaged. And it was just a few years ago that British soldiers
   patrolling Basra in soft berets mocked the Americans for staying in
   their armoured vehicles.

   The British console themselves with the thought that the real fault
   lies with America and its "intellectually bankrupt" post-war strategy,
   as their former army chief, General Sir Mike Jackson, calls it in a
   new book. And the army is still up for the fight in Afghanistan, where
   more troops may be sent. If that effort also ends in failure, however,
   the army will find it hard to shift the blame to anyone else.


   Some political prisoners have been freed but many more are still in
   jail

   AN ETHIOPIAN federal court judge surprised everyone this week by
   throwing out the charges of genocide and treason brought against
   opposition politicians and their allies arising from the violent
   protests against the general-election results of 2005. The clemency
   was not all it appeared, but it is good news all the same.

   Twenty-five of the 100 or more suspects were freed from prison
   immediately, most of them journalists and publishers. However,
   opposition leaders, including Berhanu Nega and Hailu Shawel, remain
   behind bars. They now face separate charges of attempting to overthrow
   the government of President Meles Zenawi through the street protests
   that led to the deaths of at least 193 civilians and six policemen
   after the flawed election. An independent inquiry collapsed when
   several of its judges fled abroad, citing threats and government
   attempts at a cover-up.

   Human-rights groups are heartened by the judge's decision but point
   out that the remaining charges still carry the possibility of a death
   sentence or life in prison. Opposition supporters are divided. Some
   think their leaders should now defend the charges, which they have so
   far refused to do. The verdict will relieve foreign diplomats in Addis
   Ababa, the capital; they have been tying themselves in knots to defend
   the failings of a government that is one of their largest recipients
   of aid.

   This is particularly true of the United States. Despite the misgivings
   of some congressmen, who think Mr Meles a dictator, some in the Bush
   administration see "Christian" Ethiopia (where half the people are in
   fact Muslim) as a bulwark against Islamist expansion in the Horn of
   Africa. Proof of that came to light recently with the embarrassing
   revelation that Ethiopia had been allowed to buy arms from North
   Korea, despite the UN sanctions against that country that America had
   insisted on.

   The Americans were also indirectly involved in the detention of 41
   "terror suspects" in Ethiopian prisons after the rout of Islamist
   forces in Somalia in January. The Ethiopians, who led the war against
   the Islamists, say the prisoners were not held secretly and that they
   had consular and legal representation. But they do admit that American
   and other foreign intelligence agents interrogated some of them; most
   of them are now due to be released.

   So where are the terrorists who were supposed to have been rounded up
   after the fall of Somalia's Islamists? Ethiopia is still embroiled in
   Somalia. Some Somalis say that last week's fighting in Mogadishu,
   their capital, caused more than 1,000 deaths. But no al-Qaeda people
   or Somali jihadists were reported killed or captured. Bad news for
   Ethiopia--and by extension America.


   A bitter old row shows no sign of fading


   "SHOULD Eritrea launch another war, we will make certain it will never
   ever dream of entertaining or thinking about war again." So said
   Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, in a recent speech to
   Parliament. His country did not seek war, he stressed. But if Eritrea
   launched a "suicidal" attack, it would be driven into the sea.

   Eritrea has heard it before. Ethiopia tried to drive it into the sea
   at Massawa between 1998 and 2000, and failed. Instead, 70,000 on both
   sides died in trench warfare; a stalemate led to a truce. This time Mr
   Zenawi's belligerence comes as the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission
   wound up business this month, with no agreed demarcation. In 2002 it
   awarded the disputed village of Badme to Eritrea. Ethiopia rejected
   the verdict, and has since used diplomatic verbiage to obfuscate and
   stall.

   Eritrea naturally took the commission at its word but under its
   authoritarian president, Issaias Afwerki, has alienated just about
   every sympathiser. As his rule has become harsher and more erratic,
   the border issue has loomed larger in Eritrea's national psyche. Mr
   Afwerki may disgust his compatriots by torturing and imprisoning his
   critics. But he knows Eritreans will back him over Badme.

   The border is more militarised than ever. According to the
   International Crisis Group, a think-tank, Eritrea has 4,000 troops
   inside a supposedly demilitarised buffer zone and a further 120,000
   dug in along its side of the craggy border that is 1,000km (621 miles)
   long. On its side, Ethiopia has 100,000 troops.

   A UN monitoring force is meant to pack up next month but may stay on.
   The tension gives both countries an excuse to spend more on guns and
   spies, some to be turned on domestic enemies. Neither country can
   afford such things. Ethiopia, at least 75m-strong, is bogged down in
   Somalia and fighting separatists in the Ogaden desert; Mr Zenawi says
   he is putting Ethiopia's defence budget up by 17% to $390m. Eritrea,
   with only 5m people, simply cannot keep up.


   A new bill is supposed to give black Zimbabweans more economic power


   DOING any business at all in Zimbabwe is no mean feat these days.
   Sky-rocketing inflation-- officially estimated at 7,600% in July but
   probably over 10,000%--unemployment at 80% and crippling power and
   fuel shortages are daunting enough. On top of that, price controls
   slapped on in June have emptied shelves and depleted stocks, bringing
   many shops and factories to a standstill. The official exchange rate
   was devalued last week from 250 to 30,000 Zimbabwean dollars to the
   American one. But this new rate is still at least eight times less
   than what you can get on the black market. Now, following the land
   redistribution that has devastated agriculture, President Robert
   Mugabe's government seems to have declared open season on other parts
   of the economy as well.

   In the next few weeks, Parliament looks set to pass the Indigenisation
   and Economic Empowerment Bill that might ultimately transfer at least
   51% of all businesses into local black hands. This is in addition to a
   law which already reserves 60% of most listed companies to local
   blacks. Zimbabwe's government is not the only one in the region trying
   to involve more blacks in the economy, none more so than South Africa
   with its "black economic empowerment" programme. But Zimbabwe's is
   probably the only one so far to declare, in effect, that whites or
   foreigners should not own more than half of a company. The bill
   defines indigenous as "any person who before the 18th April 1980
   [Zimbabwe's Independence Day] was disadvantaged by unfair
   discrimination on the grounds of his or her race, and any descendant
   of such person."

   In any event, Zimbabwe's bill contains a lot of ambiguity, and gives a
   lot of loosely-defined discretion to the government. It is unclear
   whether the transfer would apply only to future mergers, demergers,
   restructurings and transfers, or to all existing companies. Moreover,
   the minister for indigenisation and empowerment would have to approve
   all ownership transfers and would have the power to impose alternative
   local partners if he disapproves of those involved in the proposed
   transactions. He would also have the authority to exempt selected
   companies from the ownership requirements for a certain period. Though
   the bill says little about compensation, there is a proposal for a
   fund that would help Zimbabweans finance their acquisitions through,
   among other things, a company levy. So businesses may end up paying
   for their own change of ownership.

   In the past, similar threats to indigenise parts of the economy have
   come to nothing, so there is still a chance the bill will be quietly
   buried. However, its appearance now is hardly likely to delight new
   investors. For example Orascom Telecom, a mobile-phone group based in
   Egypt, is already fighting to protect its investments in Zimbabwe. It
   owns 60% of Telecel, a local operator whose licence the government
   threatened to cancel unless Orascom reduced its ownership to 49%.

   Other companies are trying to head off the threat by taking the
   initiative. Old Mutual, a financial institution with roots in South
   Africa, has just said it would sell 20% of its Zimbabwean operation to
   local staff, though it maintains this has nothing to do with the bill.
   Edcon, one of South Africa's biggest retailers, donated part of its
   business in Zimbabwe to local staff a few years ago, bringing its
   share down to 40%.

   South Africa's Standard Bank and Britain's Barclays, which own all or
   a majority of their Zimbabwean subsidiaries, are taking a wait-and-see
   approach. But Heinz, a food giant involved in Zimbabwe since the
   1980s, announced last week that it had sold its 51% stake in Olivine,
   a company dealing in cooking oil, margarine and soap, to the
   government. It will leave Zimbabwe altogether. Most investors,
   however, are hoping to hang on until Zimbabwe turns the corner and
   starts rebuilding its once flourishing economy.

   On the other hand, the country's economic crisis is also attracting
   investors keen to pick up cheap assets. But they need a big appetite
   for risk. Earlier this year, Lonrho, a conglomerate with a long
   history of trading in Africa, announced the creation of a Zimbabwean
   subsidiary that would primarily invest in property, infrastructure and
   hotels. LonZim has already raised over 32m ($66.2m) and is expected
   to list in London shortly to bring in more cash.

   Imara, a financial company focusing on Africa, opened a fund investing
   in Zimbabwean firms in April. But the money poured in faster than it
   could invest, and it had to stop taking new money for a month in May.
   The fund has now invested $12-13m mainly in companies listed on the
   local stock exchange--a novel form of disaster investment.


   Even the parts of Somalia that were steady are looking shaky again


   A PECULIARITY of Somalia is that while the south of the country,
   including its broken capital, Mogadishu, has burned, the north has
   been stable. Now, to the horror of those trying to put Mogadishu back
   together again, the north is beginning to crack too. Fighting broke
   out this week between Somaliland, the northern strip that has been
   virtually independent of the rest of the country for some 16 years,
   and Puntland, a semi-autonomous territory in the north-east (see map).
   Somaliland says it has driven Puntland forces out of Los Anod, a town
   in the disputed Sool region, killing six Puntlanders and injuring or
   capturing another 40-plus. Puntland says its soldiers have retaken the
   town. Yet another war seems to be breaking out.

   Sool is split between sub-clans backing either Somaliland or Puntland,
   while some of them want autonomy for Sool itself. Somaliland, a former
   British colony that was separate from the larger parts that were run
   by Italy, declared independence in 1991 and has since sought
   international recognition. Puntland's sense of identity is less
   strong; it has seen itself as a building block for a future federal
   Somalia.

   But Puntland is losing its grip. The Sool dispute has been compounded
   by the secession of much of the Sanaag region from Puntland, to form
   yet another self-governing entity in the north. Drawing on its history
   as a sultanate, Sanaag declared independence in July, renamed itself
   Makhir, and chose Badhan as its capital. Tension between Makhir and
   Puntland is high.

   A still worse headache for Puntland is the departure of its strongman,
   Abdullahi Yusuf, to become president of Somalia. He ran Puntland with
   authority and ambition, grandiosely hoping to turn it into the Horn of
   Africa's Dubai. When he went south, he took with him a lot of Puntland
   troops, vehicles, weapons and ammunition. Their departure emboldened
   other northerners with dreams of secession or autonomy, and may give
   Somaliland the edge if the dispute over Sool leads to war.

   Oil and gas add fuel to the ferment. Exploration rights in Puntland
   have been sold several times over. Somalia's prickly prime minister,
   Ali Mohamed Gedi, was furious when Mr Yusuf signed oil agreements
   without telling him, including one with a Chinese company. Mr Gedi has
   also refused to endorse exploration deals signed by Puntland's
   government.

   Meanwhile, Mogadishu is getting worse again. Fewer children are going
   to school. The city's markets are stagnant--quite the opposite of the
   government's assertions that things are back to normal. Government
   troops and the Ethiopian forces propping up Somalia's government are
   still being attacked by bombs, grenades and snipers of the Islamist
   militias ousted by Ethiopians early this year. The African Union
   promised to send 8,000 peacekeepers and then hand authority to a UN
   mission later this year. But several AU countries failed to honour
   their pledges. Uganda is still the only African one to have sent
   troops; with just 1,600 of them there, the UN is unlikely to come in
   and take over.

   The American administration and other Western governments still want
   to back Somalia's transitional government until elections due in 2009.
   A recent reconciliation conference in Mogadishu passed off without
   rancour, itself something of a success, and was bolstered by the
   apparent failure of a rival meeting, mainly of Somali Islamists, in
   the Eritrean capital, Asmara.


   Will the political dissidents be spared?

   EARLIER this year, Ethiopian courts released many of the country's
   most important political dissidents from the grim Kaliti jail on the
   outskirts of Addis Ababa. They had been there since they were rounded
   up by police following opposition protests (in which 193 people were
   killed) against flawed presidential elections in 2005. In another
   promising sign of reconciliation, charges against the 38 remaining
   defendants were reduced from treason and genocide to "outrage against
   the constitution" and "incitement to armed rebellion".

                                                                      AFP

                                    AFP

            Berhanu Nega, mayor of Addis Ababa, awaits his fate

   So it was a real shock this week when the state prosecutor called for
   all 38 to be put to death. Those facing the firing squad include Hailu
   Shawel, the elderly head of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy
   (CUD), the main opposition party, and Berhanu Nega, the elected mayor
   of the capital, Addis Ababa.

   Surely not, say queasy diplomats, aid types and even many in the
   Ethiopian government. The prime minister, Meles Zenawi, has made some
   progress in building infrastructure, tackling poverty and attracting
   foreign investment. He has even managed to turn himself into a close
   ally of America by invading Somalia last December to vanquish the
   Islamist regime in Mogadishu, suspected of harbouring al-Qaeda people.
   The last thing Mr Zenawi needs now is the terrible publicity,
   especially in America, that such executions would bring.

   The judge adjourned sentencing until later this month. Even if a death
   sentence is handed down, a carefully worded apology by the dissidents
   could let them walk free. Mr Zenawi would probably go along with that.
   There is now almost as much that unites the government and the
   opposition as divides them. Some back his invasion of Somalia; many
   others agree on the threats posed by Eritrea, Islamist terrorism and
   separatist groups within Ethiopia.

   But Ethiopians are stubborn. Most of the 38 dissidents have refused
   even to recognise the court's legitimacy or to offer a defence. They
   may be unwilling to sign an apology. Then there is the government's
   instinct for brutality. In spasms, it has muzzled, beaten and jailed
   the opposition since the elections of 2005. Thousands of young
   Ethiopians were sent to prison camps. The press has been stamped on.

   All of this puts the United States in a quandary. Ethiopia, despite
   its human-rights record, is a key ally against terrorism. America
   backed Ethiopia's invasion of Somalia. Now it is pressing Mr Zenawi
   urgently to let the dissidents go free.


   Why has the country's national prosecutor been suspended?


   AS THE business of nominating candidates for the leadership of the
   ruling African National Congress (ANC) gets under way this week, the
   atmosphere, already clouded by arguments over who should succeed
   President Thabo Mbeki as party leader, is turning nastier. Mr Mbeki
   recently suspended Vusi Pikoli, head of the National Prosecuting
   Authority (NPA), who oversees an investigative unit known as the
   Scorpions, for an "irretrievable breakdown" in relations with his
   boss, the justice minister.

   It has since been reported that, before his suspension, Mr Pikoli had
   taken out a warrant to arrest Jackie Selebi, who heads the South
   African police. An inquiry has now been launched into whether Mr
   Pikoli--but not Mr Selebi--should be fired. But the government has
   been so vague and tight-lipped about Mr Pikoli's suspension that it is
   feeding a host of conspiracy theories that could affect the ANC's
   selection, in December, of the party's next president. Whoever wins
   that contest is virtually certain to become the country's next leader
   too.

   Mr Pikoli has overseen the most recent bout of the NPA's six-year
   investigation into the activities of Jacob Zuma, the country's former
   deputy president, who was fired in 2005 but still seeks South Africa's
   top job. Charges of corruption and fraud against Mr Zuma were
   dismissed last year. But the NPA has not ruled out the possibility of
   charging him again.

   The Scorpions, set up in the late 1990s to investigate corruption and
   organised crime, have been accused of abusing their power and being
   used to settle political scores. Critics say they should be disbanded
   or absorbed into the police. A government-appointed commission
   suggested they be kept within the NPA but report to the minister of
   safety and security.

   Mr Selebi has been under fire for some time for the country's
   breathtaking level of violent crime. Calls for his sacking became more
   strident when he admitted to being a friend of Glen Agliotti, a
   suspected crime boss arrested by the Scorpions. They have been
   investigating Mr Selebi, who insists his hands are clean and has kept
   his job.

   The opposition has been demanding a fuller explanation, so far in
   vain. Mr Pikoli secured impressive conviction rates. But did he
   overstep his authority? He is said to have kept his boss in the dark
   over several big cases, including Mr Selebi's. And people disagree
   over what the NPA's independence really means. The opposition has
   questioned the independence of the inquiry into whether Mr Pikoli is
   fit for the job, since it is being headed by an ANC veteran and former
   speaker of parliament, Frene Ginwala.

   Was Mr Pikoli's suspension due to the arrest warrant? People in the
   president's office deny that the decision was meant to protect Mr
   Selebi and refuse to say whether a warrant for his arrest was ever
   obtained. So does the NPA. But Mr Mbeki's reluctance to explain things
   more fully has fuelled suspicions that state institutions are subject
   to the vagaries and bitter rivalries of ANC politics.


   With rancorous debate, the ANC elects a new leader 

                                                                      AFP
                                                                      AFP


   AFTER months of acrimony, the African National Congress (ANC) has
   elected Jacob Zuma to be its new leader. In a ballot of almost 4,000
   delegates at the national conference of South Africa's ruling party in
   the small town of Polokwane, Mr Zuma defeated the incumbent, Thabo
   Mbeki, by a wider margin than some had predicted; 2,329 votes to
   1,505. Mr Zuma, formerly the party's deputy leader, is now in prime
   position (though not certain) to succeed Mr Mbeki as the country's
   next president. Mr Mbeki, who has served two terms, has to step down
   as head of state in 2009.

   For a party renowned for its iron discipline, the scenes in the tents
   at Polokwane were unprecedented. Mosiuoa Lekota, the ANC's chairman
   and a supporter of Mr Mbeki, was booed and heckled from a boisterous
   floor. True to his style, Mr Mbeki delivered a dreary, technocratic
   speech that lasted for over two hours, listing the socio-economic
   achievements of the past decade. He ended by lamenting the increasing
   patronage, corruption and unprincipled politicking within the party--a
   thinly veiled swipe at his rival--and called for moral regeneration.
   But Mr Zuma's supporters broke out in songs supporting their hero as
   soon as Mr Mbeki had finished his address. They insisted on a manual
   counting of the votes, for fear that the Mbeki camp would rig the
   result.

   Mr Mbeki tried to rebut accusations that he does not tolerate dissent
   and has centralised power. But he failed to convince the party's rank
   and file, who strongly favour the more congenial Mr Zuma. For the
   first time in decades, the party's local branches were genuinely able
   to choose their leader; in the past he would have been selected by the
   party's top brass. A delegate from the Eastern Cape, Mr Mbeki's
   homeland, argued that change was needed. She complained that public
   services were still dismal in the rural part of the province where she
   lives. Another delegate, from the Free State, argued that Mr
   Mbeki--who has been at the helm of the party for almost a decade--had
   been in charge for too long already.

   Yet despite this victory, Mr Zuma is by no means assured of the
   national presidency in 2009. For a start, his past could return to
   haunt him. He was acquitted of rape last year, but the National
   Prosecuting Authority, after years of investigation, could well charge
   him for corruption again. His supporters dismiss his legal problems as
   a political conspiracy, but Mr Zuma would have to resign if convicted.
   In that case, Kgalema Motlanthe, the party's secretary-general, who
   has been elected as the party's number two, would take over.

   Whatever happens, the relationship between the government, dominated
   by Mr Mbeki's faithful, and an ANC led by Mr Zuma will be awkward. The
   next few months could see either a patching-up of the rift over the
   succession or a purge inside the party of Mbeki loyalists. There are
   even questions over whether Mr Mbeki will finish his full term as the
   country's president, although Mr Zuma has said that he sees no reason
   for his early departure.


   But there is still a chance to stave off a full-blown insurgency

                                                                      AFP

                                    AFP

                       All too familiar in Mogadishu


   EXPERIENCE teaches that stability in Somalia depends on peace in
   Mogadishu. So recent events in the capital are now the cause of real
   concern--again. The United Nations reckons that 40,000 of the city's
   2m residents have fled increasingly heavy fighting since February. On
   March 21st at least 15 people were killed in one fire-fight, the
   heaviest since the Islamist militias were chased out of the city last
   December. In dreadful scenes reminiscent of the shooting down of an
   American Black Hawk helicopter in the city in 1993, the bodies of two
   dead soldiers were dragged through the streets before being set alight
   by chanting mobs.

   The violence has increased dramatically since the arrival of a Ugandan
   peacekeeping force. The Ugandan troops, under African Union (AU)
   command, have formally taken over from Ethiopia, whose troops have
   occupied Mogadishu since the retreat of the Islamists. The Ethiopians
   are unpopular with ordinary Somalis, who see them as occupiers; the
   Ugandans are also viewed by militants as nothing more than interfering
   foreigners. An Ethiopian soldier was probably among those killed on
   March 21st. Some Ethiopian troops have left, and those who remain have
   withdrawn from public view, including from the presidential palace.
   But they are unlikely to withdraw completely just yet.

   In part, that reflects a failure of the AU. Only 4,000 of the 8,000
   troops the organisation has requested for Somalia have so far been
   committed; of these, only the Ugandans are on the ground. It will be
   hard for them to pacify Mogadishu, even at full strength. The best the
   AU green helmets can hope for, say Somali watchers, is to secure key
   installations and road junctions. A Ugandan force commander says his
   men will patrol only in neighbourhoods where they are welcome. That
   will make them less of a target, but it will also put some areas of
   Mogadishu dangerously off-limits.

   Much depends on the success of a touted national reconciliation
   process. Somalia's transitional government has been bullied and
   bankrolled into making a show of forgiveness, but it is unclear
   whether a national-unity conference planned for April will amount to
   much. Foreign diplomats say the government should reach out to
   moderate Islamists while excluding Mogadishu's warlords. But even with
   the best intentions that is a hard act to pull off. The warlords are
   emboldened, and may be responsible for some of the mortar attacks.
   They certainly see themselves as having legitimate claims to be in
   government.

   But remnant Islamist fighters still account for most of the violence.
   There may be over a thousand of them in or around Mogadishu. Some have
   formed new jihadist groups. Gauging their strength is not easy,
   particularly since they have taken to paying freelance gunmen to
   attack government and Ethiopian positions. The more sophisticated
   nature of recent attacks, together with pugilistic broadcasts made by
   some jihadist commanders in hiding, suggest that they may have the
   makings of a serious insurgency.

   The next few weeks will be critical. The peacekeepers need to hold
   their nerve. The government has to reach out to disaffected clans,
   especially by including them in the building of a new national army.
   And the Islamists could yet miscalculate, as they have done before. A
   grouping of Islamic courts in Mogadishu became popular last year
   because it opposed violence and restored order. Calling for violence
   and provoking disorder could swing the people back behind the
   government.


   In an [3]article on reforming Nigeria's oil industry (September 29th),
   we said that the country's production had sunk to just 750,000 barrels
   a day, owing to violence in the Delta region. What we meant to say is
   that oil production had fallen by 750,000 b/d, well below Nigeria's
   capacity of 3m b/d, but not nearly as catastrophic. Sorry.


   Few Arabs are in the mood to give Mr Bush the benefit of their doubt



   DURING half a century of American engagement with the Arab world,
   American presidents have tended to get nicer to the Arabs towards the
   end of their term, when they have less to lose at home by doing so.
   With his Middle East tour, George Bush has stuck to that rule. The
   difference is that, with America's failure to sort out Iraq or make
   peace between Israelis and Palestinians or to persuade Muslims that
   the war on terror is not unfairly directed at themselves, no other
   president has had to control quite so much damage.

   A speech in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, was touted
   as the keynote of his seven-country tour. In it, he touched on
   familiar themes, such as the wickedness of Iran's rulers and his
   belief that only democracy can free people from oppression and
   insecurity. "You cannot stand up a modern and confident nation when
   you do not allow people to voice their legitimate criticisms," he
   said.

   While officials from the host country quietly distanced themselves
   from America's Iran policy, Arab commentators questioned whether the
   head of an administration responsible for the miseries of Abu Ghraib
   and Guantnamo could preach human rights or whether Mr Bush's lavish
   praise for some Gulf monarchs' gestures towards democracy, such as
   holding highly restricted elections, meant that he cared more about
   securing cheap oil than promoting real political reform.

   The state of American-Arab relations seemed more sharply depicted in
   Saudi Arabia, when Mr Bush joined in a traditional dance with Prince
   Salman bin Abdul Aziz, the powerful governor of Riyadh, the Saudi
   capital, and a possible future king. Meant to display tribal
   solidarity as he danced, a sword-clutching Mr Bush looked awkward as
   he shuffled clumsily, arm in arm with his robed companion.

   It was, in fact, America that was supplying the real weapons, with an
   announcement, coinciding with the presidential tour, that it would
   sell Saudi Arabia 900 guided-bomb kits worth $123m as part of a
   longer-term pledge to transfer some $20 billion in arms to its Arab
   Gulf allies. Yet the sale's hoped-for favourable impact dissipated
   when an Israeli military source asserted that Israel, which is getting
   10,000 American precision-guided bombs free, would get a smarter
   version. This comment was meant to reassure America's pro-Israeli
   Congress about the Saudi sale, but certainly managed to annoy the
   Saudis. "The region needs smart initiatives, not smart bombs," growled
   an editorial in Kuwait's daily al-Rai al-Am.

   Despite the wave of sourness in the Middle East towards Mr Bush's
   visit, signs were noted that his administration, albeit late in its
   tenure, was paying more attention to Arab concerns. Assuaging fears
   that taking too hard a line with Iran could lead to a conflict that
   would hurt the whole region, Mr Bush tempered his tough language with
   the hope that if the "talented Iranian people" moderated their rulers'
   behaviour, Iran and America could become best of friends. Mr Bush also
   praised a new Iraqi law (see [3]article) to let some former members of
   Saddam Hussein's Baath party regain their jobs; some Arab commentators
   noted that it was Mr Bush's administration that had demanded their
   dismissal in the first place. The president's repeated determination
   to bring about a "viable, contiguous" Palestinian state also went some
   way to alter the impression that his administration has been loth to
   press Israel to make concessions.

   Though urging Arab oil producers to boost output to reduce the high
   price of oil, Mr Bush was careful to say that he knew many were
   already producing at full capacity. Such courtesy may reflect, among
   other things, America's appreciation that rich Gulf producers have
   declined so far to uncouple their currencies from the dollar, despite
   its falling value and advice from many local economists. Arab
   investors, including the sovereign funds of Kuwait and Abu Dhabi,
   sound willing to inject billions into wobbly American financial houses
   such as Citibank and Merrill Lynch.

   Uglier realities did intrude, however. In Beirut, an American embassy
   vehicle narrowly evaded a bomb-blast that killed three bystanders,
   further shaking the hold of Lebanon's pro-American government, which
   has been locked in a stalemate with its opponents led by Hizbullah,
   the Iranian-backed Shia militia. And an Israeli raid against
   rocket-firers in Gaza killed 18 Palestinians, the highest day's death
   toll for months. The dead included a son of a former foreign minister
   of Hamas, the Islamist group that seized the strip last summer. He
   blamed Mr Bush for giving Israel a "green light" for the killings.


   A brave woman seeks justice and historical recognition for past wrongs

                                                                       AP
                                                                       AP

                                 Still seeking justice for their children


   TYRANTS tend to be oddly punctilious about recording their atrocities.
   But even by the standards of his peers, Mengistu Haile Mariam,
   Ethiopia's former dictator, was an incorrigible archivist. The
   security services of his regime, which took power in 1974, learned the
   habits of bureaucratic procedure from true masters, the East Germans,
   who sent Stasi agents to Ethiopia as consultants. When Mr Mengistu
   fell and fled in 1991, he left behind thousands of pages of memoranda,
   death warrants and even the minutes of a meeting in 1975 when his
   ruling committee, known as the Derg, voted to murder the imprisoned
   emperor, Haile Selassie.

   These files form the basis for thousands of criminal cases brought by
   an Ethiopian special prosecutor since Mr Mengistu fell. The charge
   sheet and evidence for his trial in absentia for genocide run to some
   8,000 pages. Though he remains a sheltered guest of Zimbabwe's
   president, Robert Mugabe, a court sentenced him this year to life in
   prison, so ending the special prosecutor's work. But what will happen
   to all that fragile and incriminating paper?

   A woman named Hirut Abebe-Jiri has made it her mission to see that the
   historical record is preserved. Herself imprisoned and tortured during
   a purge known as the "Red Terror", Ms Hirut has set up an organisation
   to archive, translate and index the Derg's files, and make them
   available on the internet through a partnership with the University of
   North Dakota in the United States. A Canadian resident, she recently
   went back to Addis Ababa, which she fled as a refugee, and signed an
   agreement with the government that calls for the transfer of the
   documents into the hands of her Ethiopian Red Terror Documentation and
   Research Centre. Her model is Yale University's Cambodian Genocide
   Programme, which documents Khmer Rouge atrocities in the 1970s.

   Despite many trials over the years, many Ethiopians still do not know
   what happened to family members who disappeared during the Red Terror.
   Ms Hirut hopes that her archive and its website will let
   Ethiopians--including those in the diaspora--learn the truth.

   She knows the power of written words: they brought justice in her own
   case. During the Red Terror, Ms Hirut, then 17, was imprisoned and
   beaten up. Years later, she discovered that the man who had ordered
   her torture, a notorious Derg functionary called Kelbessa Negewo, had
   emigrated to the United States and was working as a bellhop at a hotel
   in Atlanta, Georgia. Along with two other former victims, she sued him
   in an American court. The most powerful evidence against him was his
   own memos to his superiors, in which he boasted about his "struggle to
   eliminate the anti-revolutionaries". Last year, after more than a
   decade of legal battles, he was deported back to Ethiopia. He is now
   serving a life sentence for murder.


   Ordinary Zimbabweans find creative ways to survive

                                                                  Reuters

                                  Reuters


   AT FIRST glance, life in Harare appears surprisingly normal. Cars
   still cruise along the streets, shops are still open, children wear
   neat school uniforms, and men and women in suits still talk on mobile
   phones. Yet in Zimbabwe appearances are deceptive. The economy is
   collapsing. Eight in ten people have no formal jobs; inflation,
   officially estimated at more than 3,700%, may actually be twice as
   high.

   So President Robert Mugabe has decided to try to do something about
   the galloping prices of basic goods. Ignoring protests from Gideon
   Gono, the governor of the central bank, Mr Mugabe, who famously
   despises "bookish economics", has sent the police in to order
   shopkeepers to slash their prices, forcing them to sell at a loss. The
   predictable result is huge crowds waiting outside shops to rush in and
   grab whatever they can while the going is good. Factories are
   threatened with being taken over if they stop production. Hundreds of
   shopkeepers have been arrested, accused of not lowering their prices
   enough.

   So basic goods such as cooking oil, soap and meat have disappeared
   from the shelves. At a supermarket in the Fife Avenue shopping centre,
   expensive imported goods are still on sale but the meat counter is
   empty and there is no bread. Luckily, there is a bit of cooking oil.
   Each bottle costs about one-third of a teacher's monthly wage and
   shoppers are allowed to buy only two bottles each. A woman pushing a
   trolley says she spends a good part of the day going from shop to shop
   to find basic items such as sugar or flour.

   Petrol, which was expensive but available after private importers were
   licensed, has now dried up as well, thanks to the enforced price cuts.
   At a petrol station in one of Harare's leafy suburbs, a line of over
   80 cars snakes around the block, overseen by a few policemen and
   soldiers. Without much petrol, public transport, whose fares have also
   been slashed, has become too scarce for commuters. On one of Harare's
   main avenues, crowds wait by the side of the road at night, hoping for
   a ride home. Some people run after a pick-up truck that is already
   full, trying to jump on. It can take hours to get to work in the
   morning.

   Yet most things are available on the black market--for those who can
   afford them. At night, you only have to drive to the right spot and
   young men rush over to offer petrol at more than eight times the
   official price. In the poor district of Mbare, about 3km (two miles or
   so) from Harare's centre, a few people are selling cooking oil and
   sugar at the side of the road; some carry bags of maize flour on their
   heads. But police raids this week have pushed this black market even
   further underground.

   Twenty kilometres outside Harare, a 40-year-old teacher explains that
   she cannot survive on her monthly earnings of 1.9m Zimbabwean dollars,
   equivalent to $7,600 at the official exchange rate but only $7.60 on
   the black market. Her husband makes even less. She walks 5km to work
   every day only "because there is nothing else to do", but some of her
   colleagues no longer show up at all. She grows vegetables in her back
   yard; the greens, she says, are "our chicken and our pork, our eggs
   and our beef".

   Scraping by

   There is no running water for most of the day, so she fills buckets
   and bottles whenever taps work and has to boil the water as it is no
   longer safe to drink. Electricity is also scarce, so she cooks on a
   wood fire in her back yard and buys candles whenever she can afford
   to. She wears a worn-out anorak and woollen hat in her small house, as
   she cannot afford heating to fight the biting winter cold. To feed and
   school her three children, she borrows money to buy a few things, then
   goes to South Africa or Zambia to sell them.

   Many people survive by trading. A 34-year-old professional, who has
   left his job to become a middleman, buys foreign exchange on the black
   market and imports all kinds of stuff, from IT equipment to
   stationery. He then resells at a fat mark-up to local companies that
   cannot risk breaking the foreign-exchange laws. When not driving to
   South Africa, he lounges in his drawing room watching satellite
   television on a wide screen. He says he makes a profit of more than
   $5,000 a month; he lives in a nice residential area where electricity
   and water are always on.

   There is plenty of foreign exchange, he explains. The lucky few with
   access to American dollars at the official rate of 250 Zimbabwe
   dollars to one American greenback are making a killing selling them on
   the black market, where the rate is about 250,000. Getting enough
   local cash has become the main hurdle since restrictions were placed
   on withdrawals. To get around the Z$1.5m daily limit, people open
   multiple bank accounts or pay a 10% premium to get cash against a bank
   transfer.

   Choked by hyperinflation and arbitrary restrictions, people have
   become increasingly creative to survive. More than 3m have emigrated,
   mainly to South Africa, while a small elite bleeds the economy dry. A
   local businessman says the system will collapse in six months--and
   that Zimbabwe, under new management, will become Africa's fastest
   growing economy. "Then again", he smiles, "we have been saying this
   for years."


   A country still dangerously adrift


   THE prime minister of Somalia, Ali Mohamed Gedi, has bowed out after a
   year of rivalry with the country's president, Abdullahi Yusuf--in the
   interest, he says, of national unity. In his resignation speech, Mr
   Gedi said he had survived five assassination attempts in three years
   at the helm. A veterinarian, he has seen his share of bone-crunching.
   His father was a colonel in Somalia's intelligence service during its
   steadier Soviet-backed years, a trade Mr Gedi may also have dabbled
   in.

   It was probably the prime minister of next-door Ethiopia, Meles
   Zenawi, who advised Mr Gedi to go. The pair are close. In his days as
   a rebel fighter, Mr Zenawi was protected by Mr Gedi's father. Mr Gedi
   belongs to the Hawiye clan, the most powerful in Mogadishu, Somalia's
   ravaged capital. He has been unpopular with Hawiye elders, some of
   whom have Islamist sympathies so are hostile to Somalia's feeble,
   Ethiopia-backed government. It is unclear whether or not his exit will
   make it easier for Mr Yusuf, now squarely in charge, to strike a deal
   with the Hawiye to deprive jihadist fighters of clan support and
   shelter.

   Mr Gedi flew straight out of Somalia to Kenya, the speed of his
   departure showing how even the toughest patriots are loth to build a
   life in Mogadishu. Most educated emigrs return without their
   children, as life for them is getting worse. The UN says school
   attendance has collapsed; malnutrition and cholera are common.

   The all-out fighting that ripped through Mogadishu in the spring has
   not resumed, but the seaside city remains violent. Jihadist rebels pin
   down Ethiopian troops and peacekeepers from Uganda, the only country
   willing to send troops under the aegis of the African Union. The
   failure of moderate Islamists to create a plausible negotiating
   position at a recent meeting in Eritrea may have strengthened the
   armed radicals, who hope to foment a holy war with "Christian"
   Ethiopia. The threat is not restricted to the Horn of Africa. British
   intelligence says that Somali jihadists may be involved in future
   terrorist attacks on Britain and elsewhere, as they have been already.

   The recent killing of yet another Somali journalist illustrates the
   chaos. Bashir Nur Gedi (no close relation) was the eighth journalist
   to be murdered in Mogadishu this year. Other Somali reporters have
   gone into hiding or left the country; both the government and
   Islamists have targeted them for trying to report freely.

   A sharp increase in piracy is also telling. During their time in power
   last year, Islamists managed to curb attacks on foreign vessels. Now
   they are back up to record numbers. The Americans pursued two ships
   hijacked by pirates this week, one of them a North Korean freighter
   whose crew managed to kill two of the pirates before the Americans
   arrived. There is no sign yet of a French naval escort promised by
   France's new president, Nicolas Sarkozy.


   A small European force runs into big problems in central Africa 

   THE idea of sending several thousand European Union (EU) soldiers and
   a bunch of UN policemen to protect 400,000 displaced civilians and
   Sudanese refugees from Darfur who have been sheltering in eastern Chad
   seems well-intentioned, as does sending a handful more to the remote
   north of the neighbouring Central African Republic (CAR). Here, too,
   civilians are being terrorised by local rebels and by some from
   neighbouring countries who use swathes of the CAR's lawless terrain
   for rest, transit and launching attacks.

   But a proposed EU-led mission is fraught with complications. It was
   supposed to be up and running by the end of the year but is far behind
   schedule. The latest hitch is a lack of helicopters, essential for
   ferrying 3,700 soldiers and 300 UN police around 200,000 square
   kilometres (77,000 square miles) of Africa's harshest terrain. Some
   diplomats think the deployment will be postponed until next May.

   Even if the force gets there, it is not clear how it will operate. In
   UN-speak, it will have a "multi-dimensional presence". The soldiers
   and police are meant to stop Darfur's violence spreading west by
   sealing the border. They must also protect the civilians who have fled
   and the aid workers looking after them in Chad. How they will do this
   is fuzzy. The mission's UN Chapter 7 mandate could theoretically let
   it go on the offensive to stop attacks. Or it could simply monitor the
   situation.

   Given the force's limitations, the latter is likelier. A report issued
   by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reckons the EU would need
   over 10,000 men and a lot of air power. Instead, the force will hope
   its mere presence will be a deterrent.

   Due to be led by an Irishman, the bulk of its soldiers will be French,
   plus some Austrians, Dutchmen, Poles and Swedes. But herein lies
   another problem. France can provide these troops as it already has a
   base in Chad, a former colony. It is already embroiled in existing
   conflicts in both Chad and the CAR, another former possession. So the
   humanitarian intent and neutrality of the EU force is being queried.

   France has, for instance, been using special forces to fight rebels in
   the CAR's north-east. The proposed EU force in that country will, in
   fact, consist of these same 200-odd soldiers merely swapping berets.
   In Chad, France gives logistical and intelligence help to a disliked
   president, Idriss Dby, in his battle against rebels in his country's
   east; some, in turn, have declared war on France and have warned the
   EU that its force will be treated as the enemy because of France's
   participation in it.

   The CAR's government, on the other hand, is keen for anyone to come
   and help control the country's lawless north. Villagers, businessmen
   trying to ply their trade and even the rebels operating there say that
   they, too, want stability. But those who have fled the region's
   violence are sceptical about what the soldiers will really be able to
   do. "I hear things on the radio about this force but let's see what
   happens," says Mamadou Yusuf, an elderly Sudanese refugee from Darfur
   who fled to a camp in the north-east of the CAR. "For now we are
   staying here."


   The official opposition picks its leader for a pretty thankless task


   SHE is almost certain never to become South Africa's president. It is
   virtually unthinkable that her party, the Democratic Alliance (DA),
   would ever push the ruling African National Congress (ANC) out of
   power. But South Africa badly needs a vigorous opposition to keep the
   ANC on its toes, call it to account, pick holes in some of its
   policies, and offer people alternative ideas if not the likelihood of
   an alternative party in power. For sure, the looming race within the
   ANC to succeed President Thabo Mbeki, who must bow out in 2009, is far
   more important. But the election on May 6th of Helen Zille as leader
   of the DA, to succeed Tony Leon, is a notable event. It is vital for
   the well-being of South African democracy that she makes her mark.

                                                                      AFP
                                                                      AFP

                                             Zille salutes her supporters

   After 13 years as leader of what has become South Africa's main
   opposition, Mr Leon voluntarily stepped down, enabling Ms Zille, an
   energetic mayor of Cape Town, easily to defeat two rivals for the DA's
   top job. Her supporters ululated and blew horns, dancing and singing
   re ya lewena (we are going with you). Mr Leon left the stage with
   cheers, fireworks and kwaito, a South African version of hip hop.

   He has done a good job, so far as it goes. Since 1994, what is now the
   DA has evolved through several changes and alliances. At its core is
   the old Progressive Party, whose leonine survivor, Helen Suzman, was
   for years the sole liberal opponent of government in the all-white
   apartheid-era Parliament. Competing in 1994 as the Democratic Party
   under Mr Leon, it got a paltry 1.7% of the vote. In the last general
   election, in 2004, as the Democratic Alliance, it got 12.4%. In local
   elections last year it got nearly 15%, and it now heads a coalition
   that runs Cape Town.

   The cheeky chappie goes

   Unlike many in the ANC, who think that national unity requires
   consensus politics, Mr Leon, a clever, bouncy lawyer, believes
   democracy must be adversarial. He refused a cabinet post in Nelson
   Mandela's government of national unity. The ANC has generally detested
   Mr Leon as confrontational, abrasive and arrogant. For his part, as an
   outspoken social and economic liberal, he castigates the ANC
   for--among other things--its authoritarian and centralising
   tendencies. He has also accused it of racism, including making snide
   remarks about his Jewishness.

   The DA's biggest failure under Mr Leon has been its inability to win
   votes from black South Africans, who make up 80% of the population and
   still overwhelmingly support the ANC; the large bulk of DA votes comes
   from whites and Coloureds (South Africans of mixed race), who each
   represent about 9% of the population. The DA is reckoned to get less
   than 2% of the black vote. Unless it breaks into new territory, it
   will stay on the fringe of South African politics, despite being the
   official opposition in Parliament.

   Last week's DA congress included a fair number of black and Coloured
   delegates, but its top leadership remains predominantly white. In 2005
   most of the DA's black MPs defected to the ANC. Ms Zille, whose
   parents were refugees from Nazi Germany and who herself was a notable
   anti-apartheid journalist and campaigner, will find it hard to make
   inroads into the black vote.

   Her best hope of boosting the DA is to run Cape Town better than the
   ANC runs other big cities, and to show that her party cares for the
   poor and understands the concerns of black voters. If the DA does well
   in Cape Town, it might have a chance of winning Western Cape province
   in the next general election, in 2009. So far Ms Zille has handled
   Cape Town's fragile ruling coalition well and has begun cleaning up
   the city's management. She says she wants to keep both jobs, as mayor
   of Cape Town and running the DA: a hard task.

   In her acceptance speech, Ms Zille signalled her desire to appeal to
   all by speaking in English, in Afrikaans (spoken by whites of mainly
   Dutch descent and by many Coloureds) and in Xhosa, one of the
   country's most widely spoken African languages. She said she wanted to
   build bridges between South Africa's many cultures, and even urged
   everyone in the hall to start learning an extra South African
   language. She said that "black economic empowerment", the ANC's policy
   of spreading the country's wealth more widely, "must include ordinary
   people, not just a small, politically connected elite".

   Sipho Masigo, a young DA city councillor who canvasses Johannesburg's
   largest township looking for recruits, admits it is not easy. He
   joined the DA in 2003, frustrated by the inaction of the ANC
   councillor in charge of the slum that used to be his home. In Soweto,
   Johannesburg's biggest township, he organises training, helps people
   find ways to make ends meet and tells them that democracy needs an
   opposition, pointing at next-door Zimbabwe. People, he says, are
   warming to the idea.

   But the trouble for the DA and its new leader is that South Africa's
   many poor (measures of unemployment range from 25% to 40%) are keener
   on left-wing alternatives to the ANC than on the DA's liberal ideas.
   The ANC's real opposition is from within. The trade unions and the
   Communist Party, both still within the ruling ANC-led alliance, think
   it is too cosy with big business. One day the ANC's left may split
   off, though there is no sign of that happening soon. Meanwhile Ms
   Zille, who is able and courageous, needs to plug away at promoting her
   ideas, however limited her prospects of putting them into practice.


   The small gains for democracy are now being rolled back

   TWO years ago, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt declared that he would
   allow rivals to run against him in the most populous Arab country's
   first open presidential election. This was hailed as another sign that
   political sands were shifting across the Middle East, with power in
   the world's least democratic region at last beginning to pass from
   long-ensconced rulers to their restive subjects. Some even talked of a
   democratic revolution.

   Other signals included the holding of elections in Iraq and Palestine,
   the "Cedar Revolution" that shook Lebanon from Syrian control,
   fairer-than-usual presidential polls in Tunisia, Algeria and Yemen and
   a widening of the political franchise in several Gulf monarchies.
   Voices of dissent grew louder, often via new media such as satellite
   television, even as the Bush administration trumpeted democratisation
   as the surest foil for extremism.

   The sands are still moving, but lately look more like the contents of
   an hourglass that the same old rulers have turned upside-down. Except
   for a few brighter spots, the general trend from Morocco to the
   Persian Gulf has been towards a reinforcement of central control, a
   curtailing of public freedoms, and a fading of hopes for peaceful
   democratic change. Egypt itself, a country that is often seen as an
   Arab bell-wether, provides a useful example.

   The runner-up to Mr Mubarak in the 2005 presidential election, Ayman
   Nour, languishes in prison, charged with forgery. The Muslim
   Brotherhood, which proved its potency as Egypt's main opposition by
   capturing a fifth of parliamentary seats that year, remains officially
   unrecognised. Government harassment of the group, which claims to want
   an Islamic form of democracy, has intensified, with hundreds of
   members arrested and dozens awaiting trial before military tribunals.

   Mr Mubarak's government is meanwhile pushing ahead with plans to
   "modernise" Egypt's 1971 constitution. It is true that the changes
   would abolish outdated verbiage describing Egypt as a socialist state.
   But they would also formally ban all parties based on religion, so, in
   theory, shutting out the Muslim Brotherhood for good. Judicial
   oversight of elections would be replaced by a government-appointed
   panel and special powers of arrest and eaves-dropping that the police
   now enjoy under 26-year-old emergency laws would be formally enshrined
   in the constitution. Small wonder that Egypt's secular and religious
   opposition, in a rare show of unity, have joined in condemning the
   reforms as a sham.

   The pattern of regression is similar elsewhere. After long debate,
   Jordan's parliament has approved a press law that allows journalists
   to be jailed for vaguely defined forms of slander. Similar laws have
   led to lengthy sentences for journalists in Yemen and Algeria as well
   as internet bloggers in Tunisia and Egypt. Last month, Saudi Arabia
   arrested ten intellectuals for signing a polite petition suggesting it
   was time for the kingdom to consider a transition to constitutional
   monarchy.

   Darker dictatorships, such as those in Syria and Libya, never offered
   much hope of change in the first place, and continue to silence
   dissent with gusto. But countries that seemed to offer brighter
   prospects have also disappointed. Bahrain, a small, relatively
   progressive island kingdom in the Gulf, had promised that last
   November's legislative elections would herald a new era of trust
   between the disgruntled Shia majority and the ruling family's Sunni
   allies. But electoral rules again diluted Shia votes; with opposition
   activists facing renewed harassment since the voting, unrest has again
   spread. People-power in Lebanon, the most politically open Arab
   country, did succeed in installing a reform-minded government. But
   subsequent turmoil, including last summer's war that Hizbullah sparked
   with Israel, has produced such severe political polarisation that many
   Lebanese fear the country is sliding away from the rule of law and
   back into the vicious tribalism of its 1975-90 civil war.

   Given the messy outcomes produced by more open politics in Iraq,
   Palestine and Lebanon, the region's stability-obsessed regimes have
   had reason to take pause. Yet they are not the only ones to have
   developed cold feet. Despite the fact that America's State Department,
   in its recently released annual report on human rights, contained
   harsh words about American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan, the
   tone of America's rhetoric about democratisation has grown markedly
   milder of late. Worried more by the Iraqi quagmire, the perceived
   threat of Iran and evidence of increased support for Islamist parties
   that are assumed to be hostile to the West, American diplomacy appears
   to have dropped idealism in favour of realism. Instead of bullying its
   friends, America has quietly proffered rewards, including, for
   example, assistance in developing civilian nuclear energy for Egypt
   and Libya.


   More dissent in the ruling party and in the army does not mean the end
   is nigh

                                                                      AFP

                    Can he trust his soldiers any more?


   THE political temperature in Zimbabwe may be rising again. Last week
   seven men, including serving and retired soldiers, appeared in court,
   accused of plotting a coup to overthrow President Robert Mugabe. This
   week, under South African stewardship, a delegation from Zimbabwe's
   ruling party met both factions of the opposition Movement for
   Democratic Change (MDC) in Pretoria, South Africa's capital. In March
   leaders of the 14-country Southern African Development Community had
   asked Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's president, to facilitate such
   discussions to prepare for elections in Zimbabwe next year. Does this
   mean Mr Mugabe is on his last legs?

   Not yet. But Mr Mugabe may be rattled by discord within the armed
   forces, albeit apparently at quite a low level. The alleged plotters
   say they were only trying to create a new political party. But
   discontent in the military rank and file, badly hurt by the economic
   meltdown, is rising.

   Though the top brass is a lot better off, the armed forces may at
   other levels be splitting along the same fault-line that runs through
   Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party. Some Zimbabweans say that Emmerson
   Mnangagwa, a former speaker of Parliament and long-time security
   minister, and Solomon Mujuru, the vice-president's husband and a
   former army head, may be linked to the alleged plot, though this may
   just be speculation. Mr Mnangagwa strongly denies involvement.

   The opposition has laid out a road map towards the elections due next
   year. It wants to scrap laws curtailing freedom of the press and of
   assembly. It also wants new electoral rules, reform of the
   constitution and an end to state-sponsored violence and intimidation.
   And it wants the 3m or so Zimbabweans who have left the country to be
   allowed to vote. For its part, the ruling Zanu-PF wants sanctions
   lifted and Britain to help with land reform. This week the two sides
   apparently agreed to an agenda for discussion.

   Yet, at the same time, Mr Mugabe's government is pushing controversial
   laws through parliament. One allows for phone calls and e-mails to be
   monitored. Next month the ruling party is expected to table
   constitutional amendments that would tighten its grip on power. For
   instance, Parliament, rather than the Zimbabwean people in a direct
   vote, would pick a new president, were the incumbent to step down
   between elections. Another proposed change would boost parliamentary
   representation in rural areas, where Zanu-PF has its base, and give
   fewer seats to the towns, where the MDC predominates.

   Meanwhile, inflation is hovering around 4,500%, and eight Zimbabweans
   in ten do not have formal jobs. Some aid agencies say the government
   may fall within six months or so, as the economy collapses, but they
   have been saying so for some time. Though the formal economy is in
   dire straits, Zimbabweans have learnt to cope in other ways, mainly by
   relying on the black market and getting help from friends and family
   abroad. The UN's World Food Programme says that by next year 4.1m
   Zimbabweans may need food handouts, otherwise they may starve.

   "African economies, like old soldiers, do not die," says Arthur
   Mutambara, the leader of a breakaway faction of the MDC whose passport
   has just been confiscated. At least the grimness of the economy gives
   Zimbabwe's neighbours some levers: they can dangle promises of
   economic help to nudge negotiations along. But a small elite connected
   to Mr Mugabe and Zanu-PF has vested interests in the current system,
   where price controls and an artificial exchange rate offer juicy
   possibilities for making fortunes. It is not at all clear that they
   would risk a settlement that might see them booted out of power.


   Corruption is already at the heart of Nigeria's election campaign 

                                                                  Reuters

                                  Reuters


   THE elections in Nigeria due in April are Africa's most important in a
   crowded electoral year. Much depends on their outcome: the country's
   nascent anti-corruption plan, the stability of the continent's most
   populous country, even a possible resolution of an insurgency in the
   Niger Delta region that threatens one of the West's most important
   sources of oil. So it made quite a stir last week when the
   government's anti-corruption watchdog launched a pre-emptive strike on
   the electoral process that could affect the course of the
   campaign--and even the result itself.

   The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has sent letters
   to all the political parties listing 130 of their candidates who the
   commission said would soon be charged with corruption. Those named
   included several gubernatorial and parliamentary candidates. Most
   strikingly, the list includes Atiku Abubakar, the vice-president
   (pictured above), one of the two leading opposition candidates running
   against the ruling party's nominee for the presidency. Though the
   EFCC's deputy head, Ibrahim Lamorde, stressed that it was not for him
   to tell the parties how they should act on this knowledge, the
   independent electoral commission has already advised that those
   candidates accused of corruption, including Mr Abubakar, should not be
   able to stand.

   The EFCC's intervention is unprecedented, but Mr Lamorde argues that
   the law gives it "a lot of latitude" to act in any way that it deems
   necessary to fulfil its mandate of stamping out corruption in Nigeria.
   But its action has also raised more suspicions that much of its work
   is in fact partisan, in favour of President Olusegun Obasanjo and his
   ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP). Mr Obasanjo, who tried and
   failed to change the constitution last year to stay in power for a
   third successive term, wants his successor to be Umaru Yar'Adua, a
   reclusive governor who won the nomination for the PDP in December and
   who is the younger brother of Mr Obasanjo's deputy during the
   president's time as a military ruler in the 1970s. In contrast, Mr
   Obasanjo seems to have been doing everything in his power to try and
   knock Mr Abubakar out of the race, using the EFCC as his main weapon.

   Last year the commission issued a lengthy report on Mr Abubakar's
   alleged misuse of $125m from a petroleum trust fund. He denies all the
   charges. A former customs boss, Mr Abubakar takes credit for swaying
   influential figures across the country to back Mr Obasanjo in the 2003
   elections but has subsequently fallen out badly with him. Mr Obasanjo
   tried to strip Mr Abubakar of the vice-presidency last year after he
   left the PDP for another party, the Action Congress, an opposition
   alliance which has absorbed a clutch of other PDP defectors fed up
   with Mr Obasanjo's authoritarian ways.

   Claiming the moral high ground after the commission's blacklist came
   out, the PDP immediately said that it would replace all 52 of its
   candidates on the list, whereas Mr Abubakar dismissed it as "a piece
   of cheap blackmail". Unfortunately, many will agree with him. Many
   politicians feel that Mr Obasanjo's apparently selective use of the
   commission to wage his party's electoral battles undermines the work
   of the Nuhu Ribadu, the commission's boss, who has done a lot to go
   after many of the country's indubitably corrupt politicians, including
   31 of Nigeria's 36 sitting governors. Even some in the ruling party
   wonder why Mr Obasanjo will not allow Mr Abubakar and his relatively
   weak party to campaign. "It just shows that Obasanjo has a morbid fear
   of Atiku Abubakar," says one senior PDP official.

   That fear could be justified. If Mr Abubakar, who still enjoys a
   strong following even in the PDP, were to win the presidential poll,
   it would be hard to imagine that Mr Obasanjo, stripped of his
   constitutional immunity, would be left unmolested. The ruling party
   may have to rig elections more seriously than it did the last time
   round to get Mr Yar'Adua elected. Muhammadu Buhari, a stern former
   military ruler who ran for president in 2003, is another opposition
   front-runner in this year's poll. He said this week that the PDP was
   already making headway in its race to rig the elections.


   What lies behind the latest bombings in Algeria's capital?


   ONE blast seems to have been aimed at Algeria's constitutional court
   but killed a busload of university students who happened to be passing
   by. The other destroyed the local office of the UN's High Commissioner
   for Refugees and damaged other UN offices across the street. Hospital
   sources reported 76 dead, though the government said 26.
   Responsibility was claimed on Islamist websites by "al-Qaeda in the
   Islamic Maghreb", as Algeria's main terrorist group now styles itself.
   Its declared aim was to strike a blow at "the Crusaders and their
   agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France".

   Following several years of relative calm, Algeria has suffered a spate
   of violence since the spring. This has usually been explained as a
   hangover from Algeria's particularly brutal civil war in the 1990s.
   But the nature of recent attacks reflects a broader global agenda
   promoted by the alliance, announced last year, between local Islamist
   terrorists and al-Qaeda. Nearly simultaneous multiple bombings, aimed
   at maximising terror and carrying a message of "resistance" to
   imagined enemies of Islam, have become a calling card of the terrorist
   group. Previous attacks in Algeria had been smaller strikes aimed at
   police stations and the like. Earlier this year the group tried to
   kill the prime minister.

   The seed for today's terrorism was probably planted in 1992, when
   Algeria's government annulled a second round of elections after
   Islamists had won the first. This led to one of the most spectacular
   outbreaks of violence in modern times, leaving some 200,000 Algerians
   dead. No target, even busloads of schoolchildren, was considered
   illegitimate. It stemmed from a perversion of the Muslim idea of
   takfir (excommunication), whereby al-Qaeda has declared several Arab
   governments, including the Egyptian and Saudi ones, to be apostates
   deserving death.

   Algeria's Armed Islamic Group (GIA) took the condemnation further,
   announcing that anyone not fighting against the government deserved
   the same fate. A splinter from the GIA, the Salafist Group for
   Preaching and Combat (GSPC), has since grown to greater prominence
   than the GIA. This newer group at first promised to avoid the GIA's
   habit of random violence. But in the past six months its violence has
   claimed more civilian lives, often dozens at a time. The latest
   bombings were the bloodiest yet. If the Salafist group was
   responsible, it has broken that promise.

   What makes this possible is the nature of the attack and the close
   links between the GSPC and al-Qaeda. Algeria's Islamists and Osama bin
   Laden collaborated in the 1990s. Their ties became formal last year,
   on the fifth anniversary of the September 11th attacks, when Ayman
   al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's deputy leader, named the GSPC as his group's
   North African affiliate. Since then, it has styled itself al-Qaeda in
   the Islamic Maghreb, matching the name of its affiliate in Iraq,
   al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Both titles avoid mentioning Algeria and
   Iraq, names of the modern, secular states created by Europeans. Such a
   designation seemed ambitious when the group was engaged in parochial
   fighting. But as attacks have become bigger and deadlier, the group is
   aiming to look more like an organisation in its parent's mould.

   Few expect Algeria to revert to the sustained violence of the civil
   war. An amnesty declared in 2002 has enabled thousands of former
   Islamist militants to return to ordinary life. High oil prices have
   helped resurrect what had been a nearly ruined economy, and in recent
   local elections moderate Islamists failed to make ground. Algerian
   officials say that, by choosing high-publicity targets of low
   strategic value, the terrorists display their own weakness. But they
   still generate terror.

   Refugees are returning to Baghdad, but not always for encouraging
   reasons

                                                                      AFP
                                                                      AFP

                                                     A magic bus for some


   IT WAS a stirring sight. A score of buses piled with luggage and
   decked with Iraqi flags set out from Damascus on November 27th,
   carrying hundreds of Iraqi refugees for the overnight journey to
   Baghdad. The Iraqi government, which paid for the convoy, says there
   will be many more. Improved security in the capital brought about by
   the "surge" of American troops, it claims, has prompted a mass
   homecoming of Iraqis who fled the sectarian death-squads that once
   terrorised the city.

   According to the Iraqi Red Crescent, a sister body of the
   International Red Cross, some 25,000 Iraqis returned from Syria alone
   between mid-September and the end of last month. Others say the number
   is closer to 60,000. But this is only a fraction of the more than 2m
   Iraqis estimated to have fled abroad in the past four years. Moreover,
   it is unclear whether everyone is returning for the best of reasons.

   By virtually every account, Baghdad is much safer than it was a few
   months ago. Estimates of civilian casualties are incomplete, but one
   independent tally suggests that the national death toll has dropped by
   over 50% since the summer, and the capital has seen some of the most
   dramatic improvements. Baghdadis who a few months ago were hunkered
   down in their houses say that they are now travelling across town to
   work and dining out at night. Women have abandoned the heavy robes
   urged on them by religiously zealous militias for a simple headscarf
   and jeans. Young men are taking down the makeshift barricades that
   used to seal off streets from car-bombers or raiders.

   But this is not necessarily the reason why Iraqis are returning.
   Neighbours such as Syria, which originally welcomed Iraqis, have found
   themselves overwhelmed and are now starting to cut off services. Few
   of the refugees have been able to find enough work to support
   themselves in exile. Some have simply run out of money.

   Most of the host countries seem unwilling to risk the international
   opprobrium that would accompany rounding up Iraqis and sending them
   back to a war zone. Instead, they find other ways to make it
   unpleasant to stay. According to a report released by Human Rights
   Watch, a lobby group, desperate Iraqis who have fled from Syria to its
   more prosperous neighbour, Lebanon, are often caught by the
   authorities and offered a stark choice: opt for home "voluntarily" or
   rot in prison indefinitely. Iraqis in Egypt who want to renew valid
   visas claim they are met by sneering officials who tell them they are
   not wanted any more and demand extortionate fees to process their
   papers.

   Moreover, the return of the refugees yields its own set of problems.
   Many will find their homes are now occupied by others. American
   military officers complain that the Iraqi government is not prepared
   for this looming crisis. The Red Crescent fears the refugees who
   return will simply join the ranks of the 2m-plus internally displaced
   Iraqis it estimates are scattered across the country.

   Still, the return of the refugees fits into a general weariness with
   sectarian hatred. One member of the Mahdi Army, who spent the last
   year securing his neighbourhood from Sunni insurgents by chasing away
   any Sunni who might sympathise with them, now says he is contacting
   his former neighbours and offering them pledges of safety if they
   return. This fragile goodwill may dissipate, though, if the government
   does not apply itself to finding homes for its displaced citizens.


   Was there a deal between Turkey and America?

   AS IF Iraq did not have enough problems of its own. On December 16th
   Turkish aircraft bombed what they said were Kurdish rebel positions
   deep inside northern Iraq. It was one of the biggest cross-border air
   strikes in recent years and was followed by an incursion by about 300
   Turkish troops. They were said to be lightly armed, and advanced only
   3km (1.9 miles) into Iraq. But the two actions mark a big escalation
   of the traditional hostilities.

   The Turks' targets were Kurdish fighters of the Kurdistan Workers'
   Party (PKK), who have used bases inside the semi-autonomous Kurdish
   enclave in northern Iraq to launch raids into Turkey. Although Iraq's
   American occupiers have worked hard in recent months to prevent such a
   raid, Turkey's most senior general said that the Americans had not
   only agreed to the air strikes but had also provided the necessary
   intelligence.

   If this is true, it may be the result of a delicate balancing act. The
   Kurdish enclave in the north is the most successful part of
   post-Saddam Iraq. The Americans do not want it to be destabilised. But
   they also want to salvage relations with Turkey, a vital NATO ally
   whose people have become strongly anti-American since America invaded
   Iraq in 2003.

   Many Iraqi Kurds do not believe Turkey's claim that it is motivated
   only by the raids of PKK fighters. They fear that Turkey's real aim is
   to prevent the Kurdish areas of Iraq from gaining full independence,
   which would stoke up an appetite for secession among Turkey's own
   Kurdish population. The head of Iraq's Kurdish regional government
   refused to meet the visiting American secretary of state, Condoleezza
   Rice, as "a sign of protest" against American acceptance of the
   Turkish raids.

   It may well be that America and Turkey have struck a deal. In exchange
   for American support for the limited Turkish raids, and a promise to
   order the Iraqi Kurds to take action against the PKK, Turkey's prime
   minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is thought to have made his own
   promises to George Bush. These include recognising the Kurds' regional
   government in Iraq and introducing a more liberal amnesty for PKK
   fighters.

   A previous amnesty that pardoned only those who ratted on their
   comrades failed. Now the government may pardon all PKK fighters who
   have not been involved in violence. After more than two decades of war
   against the rebels, Turkey knows that military measures alone cannot
   fix its Kurdish problem.


   A prominent critic of President Robert Mugabe resigns


   THE Archbishop of Bulawayo, Pius Ncube, has joined the crowded ranks
   of those felled for speaking out against Zimbabwe's president, Robert
   Mugabe. In July, the state-run media aired photographs that they said
   showed the archbishop in a compromising position with a married
   secretary of his parish.

                                                                  Reuters
                                                                  Reuters

                                           Will his voice still be heard?

   His supporters said it was a conspiracy to discredit him; Zimbabwe's
   Catholic church also stood by him. For many years he has criticised Mr
   Mugabe's regime in the strongest possible terms. But this week, facing
   adultery charges in court, he stepped down as archbishop of Zimbabwe's
   second largest city, denouncing the "crude machinations of a wicked
   regime".

   The 60-year-old explained his decision as a move to protect his fellow
   bishops and the Catholic church. The government said his resignation
   was an admission of guilt. Some people believe he was, indeed, the
   victim of a cleverly-sprung government honey-trap.

   Earlier this year, after opposition leaders had been arrested and
   beaten up, he called for street protests and, later, for foreign
   intervention to oust Mr Mugabe. He also said he was praying for the
   president's death. Mr Mugabe, himself brought up as a Catholic, told
   clergy who spoke out against him that they were on a "dangerous path".

   Archbishop Ncube, who took up his post in Bulawayo in 1997, is an
   Ndebele whose homeland, in western Zimbabwe, was subject to the
   government's brutal repression in the 1980s, leaving many thousands of
   people dead. He said he would remain a Catholic bishop and would not
   be silenced. But it is unclear whether he will retain his moral
   authority.

   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad thinks Iran is home free


   AS FAR as George Bush is concerned, "Iran was dangerous, Iran is
   dangerous and Iran will be dangerous" if it gets sufficient knowledge
   to build a nuclear bomb. But his words this week were barely audible
   above the clamour detonated by a new National Intelligence Estimate
   (NIE), the collective judgement of all 16 of America's intelligence
   agencies, that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons programme in the
   autumn of 2003. To Iran's irrepressible president, Mahmoud
   Ahmadinejad, the report was a "great victory"--an own thumb-in-the-eye
   for the Great Satan.

   At the very least, the spooks' reassessment of Iran's ongoing nuclear
   work seems likely to put a brake on already slow diplomatic efforts
   through the United Nations Security Council to pressure Iran into
   suspending its enrichment of uranium and its efforts to produce
   plutonium. Although a new resolution promising stiffer sanctions on
   Iran may still be circulated soon, both Russia and China say that the
   new NIE version of events means at a minimum a bit of a rethink.

   Yet it's a funny thing. Although the new judgement on Iran's weapons
   work contradicts a 2005 NIE view that Iran was tinkering on
   regardless, the intelligence folk have not changed their prediction
   that Iran could have a nuclear weapon by around 2015. So does Iran
   have such military ambitions? And if so, why the presumed four-year
   pause?

   When intelligence types talk of Iran's weapons programme, what they
   mean is work to design a nuclear warhead, master the mechanics to make
   it go bang and covertly produce the highly-enriched uranium or
   plutonium for its explosive core. In 2002 much of Iran's
   hitherto-secret uranium work, including its centrifuge-enrichment
   plant at Natanz, was exposed by an opposition group. Iran then came
   under mounting pressure to suspend such work and let in inspectors
   from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The intense
   scrutiny, the intelligence analysts think, caused Iran to halt its
   other nefarious activities too.

   Yet, as a leaked speech by a senior Iranian nuclear official later
   made clear, Iran was not abandoning enrichment, only ducking and
   weaving to get the world off its back. Uranium and plutonium work, it
   insists, are legal under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--for
   peaceful purposes. The enrichment go-slow ended abruptly in 2006,
   however, with the election of Mr Ahmadinejad. Iran now has 3,000
   centrifuge machines up and running at Natanz.

   Does that matter if all the other work has stopped? Producing enough
   plutonium or highly enriched uranium (power reactors use the
   low-enriched sort, but this can be enriched to weapons grade by
   running it through the centrifuges a few more times) is the chief
   obstacle to building a bomb. Halting the obviously illegal work, while
   pressing ahead with enrichment in plain sight would still leave Iran
   with a weapons option, argued George Perkovich of the Carnegie
   Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think-tank, back in
   2005. The new NIE assessment comes to a similar conclusion.

   Iran claims never to have had any intent to build weapons. The NIE
   disagrees. America is even more firmly convinced on the evidence it
   has obtained--some of it quite recently--that until 2003 Iran's
   government was trying to build a nuclear weapon. It was "probably
   worse than we thought", says Stephen Hadley, Mr Bush's national
   security adviser.

   It always was implausible that a country without a single working
   nuclear-power reactor would spend so heavily on, and be so secretive
   about, uranium enrichment. The IAEA still wants to know more about
   unexplained traces of highly enriched uranium found by inspectors and
   a document Iran had for years, but claims never to have made use of,
   showing how to shape uranium metal into hemispheres, a technique
   useful only for weapons. Inspectors also want Iran to account for
   drawings dated 2003 from a laptop provided to America by a defector
   the following year that show design work on a missile cone that could
   accommodate a nuclear warhead. Iran dismisses such evidence as
   "baseless".

   The latest NIE assessment expresses "moderate confidence" that Iran's
   weapons pause continues. Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, this
   week begged to differ. He acknowledged that the odds on an eventual
   American military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities have
   lengthened, but said Israel would not lower its guard "because of an
   intelligence report from the other side of the world, even if it is
   from our greatest friend." Intriguingly, while the director-general of
   the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, expressed himself pleased with the NIE
   reassessment, the New York Times quoted a senior official close to the
   agency as expressing more scepticism about what Iran is really up to.

   So where does diplomacy go from here? The NIE suggests that the
   weapons pause may indicate more of a cost-benefit approach to Iran's
   nuclear ambitions, and that some cleverer combination of scrutiny and
   pressure, combined with juicier offers to take account of Iran's
   security, prestige and other goals might prompt its regime to steer
   clear of further weapons work--though it could reverse course at any
   time. Yet that has been the basic diplomatic strategy all along: get
   Iran to halt enrichment and negotiate inducements, including
   co-operation on other advanced, but less dangerous, nuclear
   technologies, to make the suspension permanent. Mr Ahmadinejad firmly
   rules this out. Ironically, this week's NIE will make it harder to
   muster the diplomatic wherewithal to press him to change his merry
   tune.


   A chance of a proper peace any time soon looks slim


   AN ATTEMPT at national reconciliation finally sputtered into life this
   week in Somalia's battered capital, Mogadishu. Insecurity had delayed
   proceedings several times before. The place is as dangerous as ever,
   but the transitional government sounds more determined. Somalia's
   internationally recognised but hitherto ineffective president,
   Abdullahi Yusuf, declared that "not even a nuclear bomb" would
   distract Somalia's tribal elders from their task of finding a way
   forward. But few people are betting on success.

                                                                      AFP
                                                                      AFP

                                                Come back tomorrow, maybe

   Indeed, after opening speeches on July 15th, work was promptly
   adjourned; the organisers said they needed to wait for more
   participants. But mortars landing around the bullet-riddled garage
   serving as a conference hall did not help. An insurgency led by the
   Shabab ("young men"), a hardened jihadist remnant of the militias
   loyal to the Islamic Courts Union that briefly ran most of Somalia
   until it was overthrown by an Ethiopian-led force earlier this year,
   says it will kill anyone who takes part. Somalia's authorities, backed
   by Ethiopian troops, have sealed off large parts of the city.

   Tribal elders have chattered their way through dozens of
   reconciliation meetings since Somalia's central government collapsed
   in 1991. This time there may be a slightly better chance of groping
   towards a peace deal leading to elections proposed for 2009,
   especially if the elders can agree on some relatively simple issues,
   such as policing, taxation and schools, among other things.

   The Shabab know their cause will be in jeopardy if they cannot scotch
   this latest attempt at reconciliation. Al-Qaeda, which is devoting a
   lot of rhetoric and resources to turning the Horn of Africa into a new
   battleground, is equally keen to prevent it from getting anywhere.
   Much will depend on whether Mr Yusuf and his prime minister, Mohammed
   Ghedi, can be persuaded to invite moderate Islamists and elders from
   the Hawiye clan, which predominates in Mogadishu and has been broadly
   hostile to the government.

   In its confusion and scope, there are similarities between what is
   being tried in Somalia and the setting up of the loya jirga ("grand
   assembly") to draft a new constitution in late 2003 in Afghanistan.
   The difference is that rich and powerful countries have promised
   virtually nothing towards rescuing Somalia--and Mogadishu is far more
   dangerous than Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, was three years ago,
   particularly for foreigners. Moreover, elsewhere in north-east Africa
   the mayhem in the Sudanese region of Darfur has grabbed far more
   attention in international forums.

   The African Union, too, has failed to address Somalia effectively.
   Only Uganda has so far sent peacekeepers, while other African
   countries make increasingly feeble excuses for their refusal to help
   out. Diplomats whose governments have been paying for Somalia's
   reconciliation conference are unlikely to attend, for fear of being
   blown up or shot.

   Meanwhile, many Somalis are dying of diseases worsened by malnutrition
   and drowning in overloaded smugglers' boats in large numbers as they
   seek a better life elsewhere. The economy is still a wreck. In recent
   weeks Somali businessmen have been flying back to the safety of
   Nairobi, the capital of neighbouring Kenya, along with their money.
   Mogadishu's big Bakara market has been closed for days; when it is
   open, grenades and gunfire take the fun out of shopping. And as the
   reconciliation conference fails to take off in earnest, the danger
   grows that Mogadishu will soon slide back into anarchy.

   The last person to leave may not have any lights to turn out


   IT IS hard to imagine that things could get any worse in Zimbabwe.
   But, sure enough, day by day, they do. Since the opposition, NGOs and
   church groups organised a protest rally that was brutally crushed in
   March, the police and militias have been intimidating, arresting and
   beating up political opponents, journalists, lawyers and ordinary
   people alike. The government has even warned the Catholic bishops,
   once considered inviolate, to shut up or suffer the same fate.
   Meanwhile the inflation rate has passed 2,200%; last week the national
   power company announced that it would ration electricity in cities,
   possibly to a meagre four hours a day, just as the southern
   hemisphere's winter is starting to bite.

   Power cuts are already frequent, but the latest blackouts mark a new
   low. Residents of Harare, the capital, have been rushing to get
   firewood and paraffin, though a domestic worker's monthly wage can buy
   only five litres (1.3 American gallons) of paraffin or two litres of
   cooking oil. Many companies, already operating at about 40% of
   capacity, say the cuts will force them to reduce their working hours
   even more. "The whole thing is a nightmare," says Lovemore Mandebvu,
   who runs a small furniture-making factory in Harare. "We don't know
   when we will have power and when it goes. This is affecting our
   output. Then at home water runs out when you are bathing, and the
   electricity goes while you are cooking." Hospitals must use gas
   stoves, coal-fired boilers, fuel generators, solar power and candles.

   Basic staples like maize are becoming harder to buy. The official rate
   for the Zimbabwe dollar is 250 to the American one, but the street
   value is now closer to 32,000. Many Zimbabweans survive only thanks to
   the 3m or so friends and relatives who have emigrated. Every day
   desperate Zimbabweans cross the Limpopo river, braving crocodiles and
   occasionally drowning, to try their luck in neighbouring South Africa.
   Trapped into illegality there, many are exploited and abused.

   Those who stay face the increasingly arbitrary power of the police and
   militias. Since the crackdown in March, there have been raids on
   Harare districts such as Highfield and Glenview, known opposition
   strongholds, where random beatings and arrests have become common.
   President Robert Mugabe's government claims that the opposition
   Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is responsible for the violence
   and is behind a wave of bombings. The MDC says the bombs are planted
   by the police to justify repression. Last week lawyers protested
   against the arrest of two colleagues and the routine defiance of court
   orders by the police. A march was dispersed and several lawyers
   assaulted.

   The latest efforts of Zimbabwe's neighbours to improve things are
   still going nowhere. After the violence in March, the Southern African
   Development Community, a regional club of 14 countries, mandated South
   Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, to encourage negotiations between Mr
   Mugabe and his opponents. But the International Crisis Group, a
   Brussels-based think-tank, says that Zimbabwe's ruler has shown no
   willingness to co-operate with the regional initiative to prepare the
   ground for presidential and parliamentary elections due next year,
   when Mr Mugabe looks likely to run again. At present, there is little
   chance the elections will be fair.

   But some of Zimbabwe's neighbours are sounding exasperated. Last week
   the Pan-African Parliament, a talking-shop with a secretariat in South
   Africa, said it would send a mission to investigate human-rights
   abuses. Mozambique's energy company, a big supplier of Zimbabwe's
   electricity, may switch off power unless it gets paid. And South
   Africa's government, long in denial about the crisis on its doorstep,
   has just granted political asylum to Roy Bennett, the MDC treasurer
   who fled Zimbabwe to avoid another arrest. It turned down his
   application last year.

   Still, this rare build-up of pressure was released last week when, to
   the dismay of the United States, the European Union and many others,
   Zimbabwe's minister of environment and tourism, Francis Nhema, was
   elected to chair the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, where
   he will preside over discussions on land and rural development.
   Astonishingly, the UN's African members, whose turn it was to hold the
   rotating post, could think of no better candidate than one from a
   country whose agriculture has been largely destroyed by its
   government's catastrophic policies. Like many other Zimbabwean
   bigwigs, Mr Nhema himself pocketed a farm that was confiscated a few
   years ago--and has already let it lapse into ruin.
