   Playing panda politics with Taiwan

   IT'S the ultimate gift for the country that has everything; and China,
   well aware of the diplomatic power of a panda, hands them out
   sparingly. In 2007 Australia and Spain became the latest countries to
   get their own. Spain's pair were sped through the VIP section of
   Madrid airport on their way to the city's zoo. Australia's, offered by
   President Hu Jintao during a visit to Sydney, are expected to arrive
   at Adelaide Zoo in 2009 (for the usual fee, of course).

   The most political of all panda presents are Tuantuan and Yuanyuan
   (left). Now among Wolong's most famous attractions, the two bears were
   offered to Taiwan in 2005. Taiwan's independence-minded government
   turned them down, accusing China of using pandas to further its goal
   of taking over the island. The couple's names did not go down well
   either: tuanyuan means "reunited" in Chinese.

   There is still hope. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang,
   may win the presidential election in 2008. The KMT is pro-panda
   (China's offer was made to the party, not directly to the Taiwanese
   government). Despite a ruling by the Council of Agriculture in 2006
   that the pandas could not be imported, Taipei's optimistic zoo has
   been busy building a panda enclosure. A rival bid has been made by a
   nearby theme park, Leofoo Village, which has already built its panda
   facilities. Sean Chuang, chairman of the company that owns Leofoo
   Village, says there is nothing wrong with the pandas' names. A KMT
   spokesman agrees.

   Meanwhile, Tuantuan and Yuanyuan wait in their misty Chinese limbo.
   And pragmatic officials in Sichuan are doing good business luring
   Taiwanese tourists to Wolong to see the pair there.
