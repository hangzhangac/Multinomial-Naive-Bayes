   GEORGE ORWELL wrote of the Ministry of Truth (in his novel, "1984")
   that it was "startlingly different from any other object in sight".
   The same applies to China Central Television's new headquarters in
   Beijing. It is one of the world's biggest and most architecturally
   ambitious buildings, often described as a twisted doughnut with two
   leaning towers connected by an impossible looking L-shaped overhang.

   The edifice was designed by Rem Koolhaas, a Dutch architect whose
   company's [3]website describes the building (Orwellianism not
   intended) as "a canopy that symbolically embraces the entire
   population". The state-owned broadcaster's move from an obscure part
   of western Beijing to a new international business district highlights
   its global aspirations.

   For more than a year, passers-by have watched the 230-metre (750-foot)
   towers creep up at a perilous six-degree angle. On December 8th, says
   Rory McGowan of Arup, a British engineering firm in charge of the
   project, the towers were permanently joined by seven steel beams. The
   timing, at 9.30am, was important. Had it been later, uneven expansion
   of the building's frame in daylight would have resulted in stresses
   being locked in.

   The building is supposed to be ready for partial use in time for the
   Olympic Games next August and completed in 2009. Construction, says
   the broadcaster, is proceeding smoothly "under the loving care" of the
   Communist Party.
