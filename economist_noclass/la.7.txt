   In our story last week on Mexico's National Autonomous University
   ([3]"A doctor takes charge") we wrongly stated that it is the only
   Latin American university to be ranked by Britain's Times Higher
   Education Supplement in the top 200 in the world. The University of
   São Paulo and the University of Campinas, both in Brazil, are ranked
   175 and 177 respectively. Apologies.
