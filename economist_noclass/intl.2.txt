   An article ("[3]The Maladies of Affluence", August 11th) wrongly
   called Plymouth Rock the first permanent European settlement in North
   America. Apologies to the inhabitants of Mexico City (Cortés arrived
   1519); St Augustine, Florida (1565); St John's, Newfoundland (1605),
   and anyone else with a prior claim.
