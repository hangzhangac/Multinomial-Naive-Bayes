   In our story about mining in Bolivia ("[3]Tin soldiers," February
   17th), we referred to the sale of assets by Comsur, a company owned by
   Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, the country's former president, to
   Glencore. We quoted a source as saying that a side-letter required
   Comsur to repay Glencore in the case of nationalisation of the assets.
   This information was false. We apologise for this mistake.
