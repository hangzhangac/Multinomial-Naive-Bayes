   In our story on Panama ("[3]Glitter and Graft", July 19th) we said
   that COSCO, China's government-owned shipping operator, was competing
   to build a mega-port on the Caribbean coast. In fact it is on Panama's
   Pacific coast. In last week's story on Brazil ("[4]Extinct, or just
   adapting?") we said that Ciro Gomes's wife is a senator. She is not;
   his former wife is. These errors have been corrected online.
