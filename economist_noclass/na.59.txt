   A shortage of hops threatens Christmas

   JUST as the festive season gets going, drinkers in America are finding
   their favourite beer suddenly more expensive or even--horrors!--not
   available at all. Hit by price increases and shortages, many
   breweries, particularly the small "craft brewers" and the even smaller
   microbreweries, are being forced to raise prices, make do with
   modified recipes or shut off the spigots altogether.

   The humble hop, the plant that gives beer its distinctive flavour, is
   the main problem. Many farmers in the Pacific north-west, where
   America's hop production is concentrated, have turned to more
   profitable lines--especially corn, which can be made into ethanol. The
   decrease in hop production, put at some 50% over the past decade, has
   sent prices through the roof. Brian Owens, the brewmaster of the
   O'Fallon Brewery near St Louis, Missouri, says that the variety he
   once bought for $3 a pound (0.45kg) now costs five times that. Many
   smaller breweries cannot find what they need at any price. Industry
   giants like Anheuser-Busch and Miller are better off, thanks to
   long-term contracts. But even Anheuser-Busch has been forced to raise
   prices for its six-packs.

   Without their supply of hops, some smaller producers are going out of
   business, bringing to a halt the fastest-growing segment of the
   industry. Other craft brewers and brewpubs are experimenting with new
   recipes, hoping their customers will adapt.

   The hops shortage is only part of the problem. Things are no better
   for barley, used to make the malt that yeast turns into alcohol. It
   too has been ploughed under in favour of corn. Crop failures in
   Australia and Europe, combined with the weak dollar, have made it
   harder to replace the shortage with imports. Other price increases, of
   fuel, glass and metal, add to the pressure. Not such a merry
   Christmas.
