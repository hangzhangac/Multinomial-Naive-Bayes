   Transport: Would you pay $85,000 for a car you could take into the
   ocean?

   IS IT an aquatic car or a terrestrial boat? The Aquada, a three-seater
   vehicle with wheels that fold up, James Bond-style, is due to go into
   production in 2008 and will sell for around $85,000, according to its
   maker, Gibbs Technologies. In 2004 an early prototype, piloted by
   Richard Branson, a British entrepreneur, became the fastest amphibious
   vehicle ever to cross the English Channel. Powered by a V-6 engine,
   the Aquada is capable of 175kph (110mph) on land and 50kph on water.
   The company's founder and president, Alan Gibbs, wanted to be able to
   drive onto the beach in front of his home in New Zealand, which is
   often inaccessible because of high tides. But Gibbs Technologies'
   chief executive, Neil Jenkins, reckons the Aquada will appeal to a
   broad range of buyers, including urbanites in London or New York, who
   could use the amphibious craft to circumvent traffic-clogged roads.The
   Aquada will be built in America, and several states are vying to
   attract the plant. "Personally, I'd like to do it in Detroit," says Mr
   Gibbs. He hopes to employ 1,500 workers and produce 100,000 vehicles
   within five years. The Aquada certainly has novelty value. But its
   success depends on there being enough paying customers who decide that
   it floats their boat.
