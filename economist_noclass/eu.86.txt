   The riddle of Russia's offer to help defend Europe from missiles


   DOES Vladimir Putin's idea of sharing an early-warning radar with
   America make any sense? The Russian president surprised G8 leaders on
   June 7th with a proposal to end the row over missile defences in
   Europe. Instead of building a new radar in the Czech Republic, America
   could share data from the Gabala radar that Russia leases from
   Azerbaijan. Rather than placing interceptors in Poland, they could be
   based farther south, in Turkey or at sea.

   Mr Putin said this would offer better protection from Iranian
   missiles, and that Russia would no longer have to aim its warheads at
   Europe, as he had threatened. President George Bush said it was
   "interesting" and experts should discuss it. But officials at
   America's Missile Defence Agency (MDA) note that the Gabala radar is
   designed to scan whole regions, whereas the proposed X-band radar in
   the Czech Republic would send out a narrow beam to identify small
   objects in space and help direct interceptors. Gabala could be
   upgraded, or used to supplement other early-warning data.

   America's interceptors on Aegis ships and mobile launchers could hit
   Iran's present missiles that reach the eastern Mediterranean (if they
   are not fooled by decoys). But the MDA says they would struggle, at
   great cost, to protect all of western Europe, let alone America, from
   future weapons of far greater range. Siting more powerful ground
   interceptors too close to Iran means they might not have enough time
   to hit fast-moving long-range missiles.

   In short, it seems unlikely that Mr Putin means to help build Europe's
   missile shield, rather than sabotage it. But his move was a clever
   pre-emptive strike that threw other G8 leaders off balance.
