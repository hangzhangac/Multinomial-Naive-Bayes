   An early foray into telephone diplomacy


   HE IS a busy man, what with the White House to win, but Barack Obama
   can still make time to lend his niceness to places that need it.
   Kenya, the home of his late father, is in turmoil. The president, Mwai
   Kibaki, says he won a surprise re-election last month. The opposition
   leader, Raila Odinga, says Mr Kibaki cheated.

   There is ample evidence of foul play. In several places, on-the-spot
   counts showed Mr Odinga winning, but the results were changed before
   being announced nationally. Mr Odinga's tribe, the Luo, are furious.
   Many have taken up arms. At least 500 people have been killed, some of
   them while seeking shelter in churches, and 200,000-plus have fled
   their homes.

   In between campaign stops, Mr Obama is trying to help. He broadcast an
   appeal for calm on Voice of America. "Despite irregularities in the
   vote tabulation, now is not the time to throw [Kenya's] strong
   democracy away," he said. "Now is the time for this terrible violence
   to end." He spoke with Mr Odinga by telephone, urging him to meet Mr
   Kibaki without preconditions to effect a reconciliation. He has
   apparently tried to get in touch with Mr Kibaki, too, but without
   success.

   Mr Obama's father was of the same tribe as the opposition leader. Mr
   Odinga even claims to be related to the Obamas, though Mr Obama has
   not confirmed this. Mr Obama's loyalties, however, are post-tribal: he
   wants, characteristically, both sides to sit down and talk about it.
   Kenyans will at least listen to him. They usually prefer their leaders
   somewhat older than Mr Obama, but they will make an exception for
   someone who still has a chance of soon becoming the most powerful man
   in the world. Whether he can bring peace in his spare time is another
   question, though. Luos joke bitterly that America will have a Luo
   president before Kenya does.
